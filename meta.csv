Harry is now in the real world, facing the harsh realities of being used by the people he trusted , with impossibly high expectations from \'The Boy Who Lived\'. Harry is now trying to pick himself back up, learn all the magic he never had the opportunity to before, and move forward from the past.It\'s a little fun, a little angsty, but it will all be wrapped up in a happy little bow at the end. I really wanted a FF that deals with how Harry deals with with all the post-war problems and grows up and learns. I enjoy fan fiction that has happy endings, but I think the character has to grow in order for it to be meaningful. ....and I dare hope that is what I have written here.\n",2019-03-10

She might have lucked out and tested into her year, but she has as much trouble keeping up with her marks as she does with Draco Malfoy\'s unending comments.Astoria comes across a bit too formal and nerdy and has trouble making large groups of friends. Yet she quickly befriends Rhiannon Clarke, the only Muggle-born Slytherin on the record. The two might be coming from completely different backgrounds, but they\'re as inseparable as can be. It would help, though, if Draco didn\'t treat Rhiannon like some sort of public hazard. It wasn\'t like You-Know-Who was around, right?*First in series.\n",2019-08-26

They are given over to the Dark Lord, completely unaware of all of the horrors they would soon face.Harry is held prisoner for over a year as everyone who opposed Voldemort was openly and horrifically tortured and killed in front of him. He was forced to watch as the people he cared about, the people he was supposed to save, were put through unimaginable pain until they were finally gifted with the sweet release of death. In that time, Harry was also tortured to within an inch of his life, over and over again, until he too was begging for death. When Bellatrix Lestrange leaves Harry\'s cell after yet another torture session, he sees his chance to finally end his suffering. He ends his life using a Black dagger that the insane woman had accidentally left behind within his reach.
