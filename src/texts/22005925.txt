They find themselves under a mistletoe, or, more accurately, the mistletoe finds them. It’s apparently charmed to follow them, hovering just four inches above their heads, quite unmistakable and moving along as they do. 
Harry Potter - the bloody git and saviour of the wizarding world, that person,  him  , the one who must stir up Draco Malfoy’s blood and stoke his hopes - is of course one of the two of them suffering from the bloody people trailing mistletoe someone has charmed to stalk them. So him, he says, has the gall, says it like it’s  nothing , he says: ‘I guess… this is when we kiss?’
Draco, yes, him, the one the bloody boy wonder has been trailing, he has no other recourse but stare at Potter incredulously, at a complete loss as to what is the proper response here. What is one supposed to say to something like that? Not the somewhat shrill ‘What?’ that he  does not  screech, thank you very much, anything but that would have been preferable.
Harry-bloody-Potter proceeds to regard him with eyes that can't be described as anything but bedroom eyes and Draco cannot deny that he feels a little, if not a lot, weak in the knees.
‘What. You. But?!’
Harry, he who must  not  be gawked at, who Draco does not want to kiss, who he’s not been dancing with all night, he is too close to  not  kiss, and why shouldn’t they?
‘Can I?’ Harry, that Potter, him, the insufferable death of Draco’s once-believed non-queerness, asks.
 If you must  Draco should say, act, like it’s not affecting him, like it’s all normal, instead all he gets out is a breathy. ‘Yes.’
The kiss and all that follows it are utterly worth it, even the catcalls from the Ministry Christmas party crowd. He never does find out who charmed the mistletoe to chase them. No matter.
