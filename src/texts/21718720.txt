Work Text:
Remus is a tea man.
He’s easy to please, Sirius has discovered, with a proper cup of tea. After a particularly rough full moon, Sirius will set up a little fort in their lounge, put on a classic Disney film, and boil his tired werewolf a lovely cup of tea.
On the other hand, Sirius is a coffee man.
Black, with a dash of creamer, plus two sugars- and if he’s being a bit of a nark in the morning, sometimes Remus will add in a sliver of chocolate.
But on nights like these- simple evenings on the sofa, a film playing quietly in the background, his husband nuzzled up against his chest as they whisper close, with a cup of tea cradled in Remus’ warm, tawny hands, bronze curls tickling his nose- Sirius finds himself a bit fonder of the fragrant drink his husband so adores.
This is partially because it gives him a warm, lovely feeling in the pit of his stomach when Remus fixes him with a teasing glare, but mostly it’s on account of his husband’s endearing reactions whenever he steals a sip.
He wrinkles up his nose and gives the most wonderful laugh, soft and breathy, and sometimes Sirius is even rewarded with a snort or two.
And it’s only an added bonus when Remus awards him a long, leisurely kiss that bloody fucking melts his insides, and sustains him for days on end.
(Remus claims that he’s only taking back his fair share of the stolen tea.)
