Without her disorder, Luna doesn't know who she is anymore, and some repressed memories begin to surface... but Ginny is there for her every step of the way. When term ends and Ginny comes to spend the summer at the Lovegood House, Luna realizes she doesn't have to go through this alone... and she's going to be okay. Despite the challenges, her self-confidence, sexuality, and spirit begin to flourish. Recovery might be harder, but at least she's on the other side.At last, Luna Lovegood is done shrinking.
