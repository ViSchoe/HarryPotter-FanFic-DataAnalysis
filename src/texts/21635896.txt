Chapter Text
My friend Orlando_Switch wanted to see a Queer Eye for the Straight Guy makeover of canon!Snape. I hope this jingles your holiday bells! (But the big questions is... who convinced him to get a makeover and why? Suddenly attracted to an intriguing former student? Lost a bet to Minerva? Under the Imperius curse?)Â

Happy Holidays dear hbart! I hope this will roast your chestnuts! 
The ubiquitous Muggle holiday behavioral device known as the Elf on a Shelf is insensitive in the wizarding world. Severus Snape believes he has come up with a solid replacement, but the rest of the family is not so sure...



Notes:
Shout out to too_dle_oo as well - any excuse to revisit the Snape Family from 2017's DAY 4, and of course her charming and hilarious fic Caga TiÃ³ Lucius, or 'Shit, Uncle Lucius!' - which everyone should read and/or reread immediately.

Summary:

Happy Holidays to you, my dear chienne_folle! 
First, my apologies for the roughness of this sketch - I was drawing it on the flight to Florida and my computer died unexpectedly and I lost the thing. So, I recreated it as best I could in the time I had last night. Perhaps one day I will dig back into it and do justice to your delicious prompt: 

After the war is over, McGonagall makes some changes at Hogwarts. One of them is that pagan celebrations of the Wheel of the Year are given equal time with celebrations of Christmas and Easter. There is to be a play put on as part of the Winter Solstice festivities, and Hermione is chosen to portray the Maiden, McGonagall the Mother, and Augusta Longbottom the Crone. Practicing for the Solstice play enables Hermione and McGonagall to get to know one another as adults, and they fall in love while rehearsing their play.
