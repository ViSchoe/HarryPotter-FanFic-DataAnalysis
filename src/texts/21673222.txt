Harry turns the two sickles over in his grasp. They offer little comfort in themselves. Still, turning the coins over between his fingers offers a distraction if nothing more. He counts the rotations between his knuckles, an old trick he had watched his uncle teach Dudley years ago, and tries not to think of the broken wand in Hermione's pack. He tries not to think of the odds stacked against them that number far higher than his simple counts of one, two, three four, catch in his hand and work back. One, two, three four. One day at a time.
