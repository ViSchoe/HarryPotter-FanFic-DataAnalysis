Draco was absolutely thrilled, as in over-the-mountains, completely out-of-his-mind, thrilled. Nimbus 2001 abandoned on the grass of the Hogwart’s Quidditch pitch, he was practically dancing on the spot, snitch fluttering slightly in his palm.
“I caught the snitch before you! I actually caught it!” His grin was beyond huge, his eyes lit up, normally impeccable hair forgotten as he jumped up and down.
Harry grinned back at him, strangely enchanted by the sudden exuberance from a normally reserved person.
Draco suddenly stopped and glared at him. “If you let me catch it on purpose, I’m going to murder you.”
The Savior of the Wizarding World shook his head. “I didn’t do anything. It was all you.”
The grin was back, and the blonde was back to jumping around ecstatically. “I caught it before you! I beat the Boy Who Lived! I’m so happy I could kiss you right now!”
“Oi!” Ron’s voice broke into their conversation, and a hastily muttered Protego stopped Draco from approaching. “None of that!”
Harry crossed his arms across his chest and turned to glare at his best friend. “Ron.”
“What! He was going to molest you!”
“And your point is?”
“Wait… you mean… you want…?”
“Yes.”
“You like…?”
“Yes.”
Ron fainted.
Draco kissed Harry.
