River
 “No, left, Remus, paddle left!” From the bow of the canoe, sunlight glinting off his dark hair, Sirius was laughing so hard, he could hardly hold his oar.“Oh, excuse me, who said ‘watch out on the left’, clearly implying paddle right –” But Remus was laughing, too. It was so long since they’d had a day like this: the splashing river, his friends, nobody on duty or in danger.“Oi, you two, less flirting, more paddling!” James yelled from the canoe ahead, Lily steering.Sirius flicked water at James’ retreating back, then turned, grinned and threw Remus a wink.  
Sea 
 He was drawn to the sea. At the oddest times, the strangest hours, Remus would find himself standing on the rocky shore, staring out over grey waves.He couldn’t help it; it didn’t help anything. Yet he was drawn to that expanse, to the knowledge that Sirius was on the other side.Azkaban. An ugly word.A fitting place for a person who’d done something unspeakable.Remus still wondered. Nothing he’d known of Sirius suggested it was possible. Sirius would have died for James. Surely he would never betray him?Remus wondered. And he wondered if he would ever know.  
Stream
 He hadn’t heard Sirius approach until he was beside Remus, by the little stream below the cottage.“It’s not much,” Remus said, meaning the ramshackle cottage, where he’d lived since leaving his disastrous year at Hogwarts.“It’s lovely,” Sirius said, maybe meaning the countryside before them, or perhaps something else.They both gazed out at the rolling green hills, the cheerful babbling brook, and breathed quietly, together.“You could have gone anywhere, now that you’re free,” Remus said, turning to Sirius. Then, in case his meaning wasn’t clear, “Thank you for coming here.”Sirius slipped his hand into Remus’. “Always.”
