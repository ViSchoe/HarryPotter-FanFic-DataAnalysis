It's a minor miracle that nobody gets hexed the first time Draco attends the annual Weasley Christmas Dinner.

What keeps the Weasley siblings in check is another matter in check is another matter entirely and remains a secret until they're all old and grey and more than tolerant of each other, and they've all been family for so long that it's a mere formality and not needed.
