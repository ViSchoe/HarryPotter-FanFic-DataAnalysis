Harry/Draco
Draco: “Potter, all my life I’ve been suffocating under the weight of my father’s expectations and struggling to free myself from the darkness in my soul. But your bravery has shown me the error of my old ways. From now on I shall devote my life to defeating the Dark Lord, combating anti-Muggle prejudice, and making the world safe for blibbering humdingers and puppies!”Harry: “I don't believe you.”Draco: “Alright, alright, the real reason I switched sides was because I heard you were dynamite in the sack. Now can we please get on with it?”[Sex]

Harry/Fred/George
Fred (nibbling Harry’s ear): “Do you know why we like you best?”Harry: “Is it because I’m courageous, loyal, and -- oh yes, just like that George -- have great stamina?”George (flicking Harry’s nipple): “Nope, guess again.”Harry: “Um, because I just turned eighteen and yet I'm miraculously acne-free?”Fred: “No! It’s because you…”George: “…are the only one,”Fred: “…who could ever tell us apart.”[Sex]

Harry/Neville
Harry: “See, there’s this bond between us. The Prophecy could have applied to you too, and had Voldemort decided to confront your family instead of mine, you would be the one with the fate of the Wizarding World resting on your shoulders. So I think you’d understand better than anyone else why… actually, I don’t see how this leads to my next point, but wanna shag?”Trevor the Toad: *Ribbit*Neville: “Okay.”[Sex]

Harry/Sirius
Harry: “Look, I’m not my father. If we become lovers, I won’t think you’re trying to use me to resurrect the closeness you once shared with your dead best friend.”Sirius: “That’s all very well, but am I alive or dead?”Harry: “Does it matter?”[Sex]
Harry/Snape
Harry: “Look, I’m not my father, and you don’t have to hate me anymore!”Snape: “Believe me Potter, I have abundant reasons to loathe you for yourself.”Harry: “Oh. Well then…”Snape: “But that doesn’t mean we can’t shag.”[Sex]

Harry/Voldemort
Voldemort: “Because I am a moron devious and cruel evil overlord, I shall not kill you. Instead, you will be permitted to live a life of utter degradation as a plaything for myself and my minions.”Harry: “Do you still remember all those pervy tricks from when you were Tom Riddle?”Voldemort: “Yessss… and I’ve trained all of my Death Eaters as well.”Harry: "Oh my..."[Kinky non-con group sex]
