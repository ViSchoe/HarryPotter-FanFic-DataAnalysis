Chapter Text

You sit there, dumbly staring

Tousled hair and graceless,

Shining, so like your father,

(He was always Better,

More than I could be)
 
A careful monologue escapes me,

Both challenge and entreaty,

If nothing else, a furious demand

You will respect me

(You 

will 

respect me)
 Did you do your reading
Did you care enough to study

Is my art 

worthy 

of a celebrity?

You will seek out my knowledge

(You 

will

 respect me)
 
It should be more difficult

Hatred for a child, yet

Tousled hair and graceless,

Shining, you are so like your father

(How can you ever respect me?)
 
You display my greatest failure - 

Skulking in the hedges, praying,

Verdant light, a mother screaming,

Cries of an injured babe

Through the darkness creeping.
 
Cries of an injured babe

Ringing in the hollows of my skull

When I dare attempt to sleep.
