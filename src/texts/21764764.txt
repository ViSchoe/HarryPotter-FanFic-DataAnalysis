“You’re such a slut,” Harry hisses, and he’s not even sure himself why it comes out so angry instead of just taunting, but he’s pissed off, and he just doesn’t care right now.
Neville turns slowly, scanning the corridor, until he sees Harry leaning in his shadowed niche. “Excuse me?” he raises an eyebrow and steps closer.
Harry doesn’t move. “I don’t think I will,” he bites out. “It’s pretty inexcusable to drape yourself all over some random idiot like Thomas. I suppose you only spared us the hand holding to prevent violent illness en masse.”
Neville blinks rapidly like he’s trying to process what Harry’s on about, which, seriously, Harry was under the impression the other boy was smarter than this.
“Are you jealous?” Neville asks, and he’s clearly amused, the jackass, can’t even have the decency to get defensive.
“Don’t be ridiculous,” Harry snaps, feeling offended. “Why in hell would you think that?”
Neville’s mouth twitches like he’s trying to hide a smile. “No reason,” he replies, then has the nerve to turn and walk away.
Harry scowls at the sound of laughter echoing down the corridor.
