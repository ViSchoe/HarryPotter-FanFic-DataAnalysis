Second year, what a doozy
The train ride started happy
When suddenly we were quite woozy
We were all sad, ‘though some were quite snappy.Creatures of darkness
Within the shadows they travel
Their cloaks utter in their starkness
Our memories began to unravelThankful for the ragged man
Who cast a light so bright
As the Consumption had began
It served to stave off the blightDarkened hoods and skeletal hands
What they are few understands.

No, ‘though i felt quite abashedThese monstrosities do nothingBut continuously dredgeMemories that are naught but crushingI may end up on a knife-edgeOne person stays my handFrom anything to drasticA lady, like from the fairylandWhile it doesn’t stop it, the knife is less enthusiasticRed like RosesThrough blood relieved, my woes is.
