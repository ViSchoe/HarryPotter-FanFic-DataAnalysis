Gods his hands were beautiful. Slender and long fingered, with perfectly shaped nails that were trimmed short. Bluish veins showed through the luminous pale skin of his wrists, disappearing beneath black cuffs. 
He always wore black. He sported a green scarf occasionally, usually when Slytherin had a quidditch match. Fitting, as he was Slytherin Head of House.

His nimble fingers and long hair always pulled back at the nape of his long neck were just the start.  
Emma had heard the rumors that he’d been a Death Eater in his youth. She had a hard time picturing the man before her could have a drop of evil in him. No, the man she saw that coaxed the most difficult potions into being with minimal effort and a patient hand. 
Even as she watched, he filled a vial with a shimmering blue potion without spilling a single drop, his clever fingers holding it so carefully. He held his wand the same way; with a delicate finesse that made the greatest of artists look clumsy with a paintbrush.

“Excellent. Five points to Hufflepuff.” 
She grinned, watching his grey eyes brush over her cauldron, simmering with a perfect potion. 
“Thank you, Professor Malfoy.”
