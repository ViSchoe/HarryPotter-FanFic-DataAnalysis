She's laying on the lush spring grass, right under the blooming lilac tree. The sun's rays peek trough the treetop, falling on her in sheets of glow, making her pale skin glisten and shine golden.
He looks at her through the hedge, hard wood of his wand digging into his palm as he tries to keep himself from reaching out, sneaking in, forcing himself into a sliver of the world carved out solely for her.
As he looks, she rises up on her elbows, tilting her face up to the sky, eyes closed and a small smile on her lips. Her long, messy hair hangs under her, part of it still on the ground, but a tendril of it hangs over her bare shoulder. The sun falls onto her face then, and she glows like she is the sun and sun is she. And her rosy lips part and she takes a shaky breath, the sound of which reaches him in the still afternoon air.
He watches patiently as she exhales, her chest sinking into itself, with baited breath.
Slowly, a light breeze ruffles through the grass, the hedge, rising into the top of the lilac tree. It shakes the little lilac flowers from their clusters, showering her in them.
And she laughs, bright and sparkling and free and it warms him to his core.
