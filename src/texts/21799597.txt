The Dragon in Gringotts Speaks I was down in the basement
the dungeons
guarding the wizards’ most valuables
while they keep me in chains
and darkness
when these kids came along
I could tell they were kids
they smelled newer
age and bitterness leave a trace
They were the only ones in years
who seemed concerned
about my condition
that’s how I knew
it was my time
to break through the ceiling
fly free
