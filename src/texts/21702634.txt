I thought being a witch would be different. Extraordinary. Hogwarts is certainly more exhilarating then muggle school. Instead of cutting up frogs for dissection, we cut them to make potions. We say some silly words and pineapple dance and mice turn into snuffleboxes. The world is at the tip of our comically large wands. Yet when magic is everywhere it seems unmagical somehow. Parchments essays, bad teachers, goblin wars...where's the voodoo and crazy rituals? The witchcraft? It's not like I want to go back to muggle life or anything but they somehow managed to institutionalize magic. How dreadfully ordinary.
