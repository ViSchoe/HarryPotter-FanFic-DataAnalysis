The prophecy has told meThe enemy I must faceI must sacrifice myselfThis burden was placed with meI can't help but feel the guiltI drown myself in sorrowLosing those I've loved todayI'll have to let my love goAnd the friends I leave behindThis is the final battleThe end is near I must goWe must win with victoryWith family behind meOnward I go to the end
