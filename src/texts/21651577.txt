In the private’s of his house, when the night is darkest and there’s hate (boiling, screaming hate) lodged in his throat, in his pulse (heavy-sharp), where his breath lives (stuffed in his lungs) (he can’t breathe. he can’t breathe) and Severus is choking on his tears (on the burning memories) (lily, eyes hollow and dead. and Albus falling and falling. and him with the wand very cold in his hands) (it’s his fault. It’s his fault. It’s his fault.) and there’s something dark-heavy in him — feelings crushed where his heart is supposed to be - he — thinks snivellus. 
And he hates, hates, hates.
