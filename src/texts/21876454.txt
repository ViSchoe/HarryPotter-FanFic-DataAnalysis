Gryffindor, her little boy, was sorted in Gryffindor.  Walburga watched with a heavy heart as she looked at her eldest son - Sirius - she had to push him away for his protection, she loved him so much- her little boy; that favoured too much of her and not enough of his father. they where Black's they don't get into Gryffindor, he would be ostracized by his own house- Unless she pushed her son away, made it, so he wanted nothing to do with them for his protection, she would do what a Mother was meant to do- look after their child no matter the cost, no matter the pain involved.she looked to her husband- Orion - with a crestfallen face, "we have to do it, for his safety, I contacted my Aunt Dorea she will take him in when the time comes, she and Uncle Charlus have a son- James - who is Sirius' age and also in Gryffindor, they will look after him,
Aunt Dorea will treat him as her own he will be happy.Walburga looked at her son, his curly black hair- his closed grey eyes, he looked so peaceful asleep, Walburga kneeled beside her eldest bed."Remember Sirius Mother loves you, she needs you to be strong, but always remember we Blacks, we love with all our heart, never forget that Mother does what she can for you, even if it will hurt us both." kissing his head she stands up, a lone tear making its way down her pale face. Walburga sat down in the sitting-room and looked out the window, looking at the constellations her Family was known for, she sat there even when the fire went out, till the sun rose.They say to love is to destroy, at that moment Walburga solemnly agreed.
