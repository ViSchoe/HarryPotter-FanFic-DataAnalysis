Boy meets world
And it’s the most normal thing
His parents are laughing
His uncles are cheeringBoy meets death
And it’s anything but normal
Because death takes
Everything but himBoy meets wizard
In half-giant form with a pink umbrella
A cake drawn in the dirt
While treacherous waves crash in warningBoy meets boy
But only for a moment
In an Alley, filled of garments
With a blink, he is goneBoy meets friend
And then another
In a station, in a wall
On a train, ‘we’ll take the lot’Boy sees boy
And this time it’s different
Anger and hatred
Hands not shakenAnd that’s when the story changes
Potter and Malfoy, names said with scornYou see,Boy sees boy
And boy hates boy
And boy watches boy
And boy hexes boyButButBoy sees boy
And boy has a chance
To send boy to death
But boy can’t be sureCan’t 
Won’t
Boy meets death again
And death takes him this time
With a scorching green light
And then all is white ButButBoy always comes back
For the ones he loves
Like house-elves and
Blond-haired boys with grey eyesBoy went one way
And boy went another
And in the end
they end up togetherIt’s beautiful
