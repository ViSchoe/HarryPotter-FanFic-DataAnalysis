PART ONE
Draco had been working for approximately fourteen hours when Potter was brought in.Fourteen hours wasn’t even that much compared to some days, but all Draco wanted to do was go home, change out of his robes, and collapse into bed. He did not want to see Harry Potter’s limp body being carried in on a stretcher.Once he had gotten over the initial shock, Draco hurried over to the shocking sight. Trainee Healer Bethia Burke and Healer Leonel Estrada were running the stretcher and casting diagnostic spells.“What happened?” Draco asked, trying his very best to keep his voice even. He was working – this was his job; he fixed the people who came in regardless of who they were.“Healer Lloyd found him,” Leonel said, still instructing his quill to take down notes on the pad that was racing to keep up with him. “The patient had fainted on the sidewalk a few blocks away. It’s lucky Lloyd decided to walk home today; who knows how long it could have been before someone else found him?”“How are his vitals?” Draco asked, his professionalism finally taking over.“His pulse is weak but it’s there.”Draco swallowed and nodded. He quickly spotted an available room for Potter.“Here.” He hurried over and held the door open. “Put him in here.”The Healers led the stretcher into the room as instructed. Once in, they levitated Potter onto the bed and continued to cast more diagnostic spells.Draco felt for Potter’s pulse, his wrist cool underneath Draco’s fingers. Like Leonel had said, it was weak.“Alcohol levels are high,” Betty said, her voice high and clear. Her wand was producing a thin, red, vertical line, which she looked at intently.“So are the potion levels,” said Leonel, frowning at the red swirling shapes in front of him. “I’ll have to determine what potions are in his system.”“Good. I’m taking this,” Draco said a second before claiming Leonel’s notepad.Leonel gave a short nod, focusing more on the spells than on Draco.He quickly skimmed over what was written. It was essentially what Leonel had told him earlier – Healer Selina Lloyd had been walking home when she came across a figure sprawled on the sidewalk. She had then called Leonel over from St. Mungo’s. Together, they had brought him in. Not much was known about Potter’s condition just yet – just that he’d been unconscious when found.Draco dropped the pad where it had been levitating earlier; it obeyed and resumed floating by Leonel’s side. He then left the room to fetch Potter’s existing medical files. Upon finding only outdated ones, he started a new one, along with paperwork for this visit. He quickly filled out what he could on his way back to the room; he’d have to wait until Potter regained consciousness to complete the rest.Draco gazed at Potter, his grip on the files tight. Potter had dropped out of Auror training six years ago, along with Ron Weasley. Weasley, however, remained in the public eye even now. He’d been working at Weasley’s Wizard Wheezes with his brother since dropping out.Potter, on the other hand, had hardly been seen in the past five years. His disappearance hadn’t stopped the Prophet and countless other news sources from writing about him, of course. Articles were still being published – filled with speculation more than anything else – wondering where he was, what he was doing, and would he be returning to the Wizarding world anytime soon?And here he was, returned at last. Draco never thought it’d be like this.Potter was much thinner than he had been before his disappearance, which was saying something – he’d always been a bit scrawny. His face was gaunt; his hollowed cheeks and chapped lips made Draco’s heart fall. His light brown skin was covered in a thin sheen of sweat, his unwashed hair sticking to his forehead. He also had a fair bit of unruly facial hair.Draco crossed his arms and observed his coworkers at work. Leonel was deep in thought, his eyebrows furrowed and hand on his face. Betty was nibbling her lip, her forehead pinched in concentration as she scribbled on her own notepad.“Betty,” Leonel said abruptly, catching Draco’s attention, “Have you tried Indica Externa?”“Oh no,” she said, blue eyes wide. “I’ve only tried Ostendo.”“That’d work too, but in this case, I think the Foreign-Identifier spell would be even better.”Betty nodded, and with a careful wave of her wand, said clearly, “Indica Externa.”Spidery letters floated out of her wand and into the air, identifying what foreign chemicals were in his system. Betty gaped, and Draco didn’t blame her – the list was extensive and rather worrying. A good number of the potions induced sleep. Draco tried to ignore the sickening thought that rushed to the forefront of his mind – had Potter tried to commit suicide?No, no. It wasn’t possible. Potter was presumably on his way to St. Mungo’s. He wanted help, right?Draco tried to focus on Leonel, who was carefully copying each item onto his notepad.“Could you classify those potions and take a look at those ingredients? See if anything reacted badly with another?”Leonel nodded and left. Draco turned to Betty, who had a troubled expression on her pale face.“Betty, could you fire-call his closest contacts? They’re most likely Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.”“Yes, sir,” Betty said and hurried out of the room, leaving Draco alone in the room with Potter.Draco carefully set up monitory spells to watch Potter’s vitals before sitting down. However, he didn’t get to sit for too long – Scarlett Mitchell, the Healer-in-Charge of the PAPP department, walked in a moment later. Her dark dreadlocks were tied back from her face, her eyes hard. Draco stood up hurriedly, though Mitchell was paying more attention to Potter than him.“So it’s true. What’s Harry Potter doing here?”“I’m not sure, Healer Mitchell,” Draco replied, “Though I believe that he may have overdosed on a number of potions. Healer Estrada is currently running a potion screening and Trainee Burke is calling his emergency contacts. Or rather, those who I guessed to be his emergency contacts.”She finally looked at him.“He doesn’t have any listed?”“It seems the only medical records we have for Potter are outdated – they’re from Hogwarts and the Ministry.”“Who’s the emergency contact listed on the Ministry records?”“Ginevra Weasley,” Draco answered. “However, I decided not to attempt to call her as her work requires her to travel extensively.”“Do you know for certain that she’s not in the country?” Mitchell crossed her arms.“Yes, Healer. I was told a few days ago by her partner that they’re in New Zealand until the end of the month,” Draco said, thinking back to the owl Blaise had just sent him.“Alright,” Mitchell said, her face slightly less tense. She turned back to look at Potter. “I’m sure Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger will be here soon.”“Yes, ma’am,” Draco replied softly.As if on cue, Betty walked into the room, followed by a slightly frantic Granger and Weasley. Betty stepped aside as the couple approached Potter’s bedside. The worry was obvious in their faces, and Draco felt another twist in his stomach. He’d seen them quite a bit in recent times, especially since Blaise and Ginevra had started dating.“Malfoy,” Weasley nodded. “What’s happened?”“Weasley,” Draco greeted shortly. “One of our Healers found him a few blocks away from here at around 9:40 PM. He was brought in unconscious, so we don’t know what it is that happened exactly, though another Healer is determining the cause of his state as we speak.”Draco could tell that Granger’s mind was already furiously at work, and Weasley mostly looked sick.“Do you have any guesses as to what caused it?” Granger said, saving Weasley from having to speak.“We found an alarming amount of potions in his system,” Draco said apologetically. He hated this part – seeing the faces of loved ones as he explained what had happened. He trudged on. “Some alcohol was apparent as well, though its content isn’t as significant as the potions.”Granger leaned against Weasley, her hands covering her face. Weasley put his arm around her, as if they could get any closer, and kissed the top of her head. She looked up at him with watery eyes.“Oh Ron, we should have done something,” Granger said desperately. “We should have gotten him help before this happened – we could have stopped it! We’re so awful and careless…how could we have let this happen?”Weasley’s face was troubled as he stroked her bushy hair.“It’s not our fault, Hermione,” Weasley said, though it sounded like he was trying to convince himself as much as Granger. “We couldn’t have known it was this bad. You know how he is about hiding things…”When Granger didn’t respond, he turned his gaze toward Draco.“When will we know which potions he had in him?”“Healer Estrada should be finished evaluating them soon,” Draco replied.Weasley nodded. “Right.”“Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger,” Mitchell said kindly, stepping forward a bit. “I’d just like to assure you that we’ll treat Mr. Potter to the very best of our abilities. I oversee the Plant and Potions department, and I ensure it is only staffed by the very best. I am Scarlett Mitchell, and Healer Malfoy here is the head of the Strife Feirold Ward. Though it seems you may already be acquainted…?”Granger and Weasley nodded. Mitchell’s eyebrows rose infinitesimally.“Yes, well, he is very capable, both as a leader and a Healer. Healer-in-Training Burke,” Mitchell said, extending a hand towards Betty, “can testify to this, I’m sure.”“Yes ma’am,” Betty said, her cheeks turning slightly pink as Mitchell turned the attention to her. “I’m very lucky to be studying under Healer Malfoy and I’ll do all I can for Mr. Potter, I promise.”“Thank you, all of you,” Granger, who had composed herself, smiled slightly. “We’re lucky Harry’s in such good hands.”“Yeah, thanks,” Weasley echoed.A knock at the door brought their attention to Leonel, who stepped inside, a grim look on his handsome face. He didn’t look at the parchment in his hands before he spoke, choosing instead to meet Granger’s and Weasley’s worried eyes.“I’m afraid to tell you that there were numerous potions in Mr. Potter’s system, all of them having to do with inducing sleep or calmness. Fortunately, since many of them have the same sort of ingredients, there isn’t too great a risk. However, the lavender in the Sleeping Draught may have had a bad reaction to the syrup of hellebore in the Draught of Peace, both of which were found in Mr. Potter’s system. It isn’t mortally dangerous, but it would be best to cleanse his system as soon as possible to avoid any permanent damage.“So that’s what I propose our team to do immediately.” Leonel glanced at Draco and the others, who nodded. Reassured, Leonel went on, shifting his attention back to Granger and Weasley. “Cleansing is a fairly easy process, though it must be done over a span of several days and can be painful at times. Of course, we’ll do our best to make it as painless as possible.”Granger’s eyes were watery again. Weasley sagged with relief, though his arm remained around Granger’s waist protectively.“Thank you so much, Healer…?” Granger said.“Leonel Estrada. And you are Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley, if I’m correct?”They both nodded.“It’s wonderful to meet you both,” Leonel said, his voice gentle. “I just wish it was under better circumstances.”“You and I both, Healer Estrada,” Granger smiled.Draco could have sworn Weasley’s grip tightened; he bit down a smile. It was hard to blame Weasley, to be truthful, since Leonel was handsome and charming in a slightly nerdy way. Still, Draco didn’t think Granger could ever leave Weasley that easily, and there was also the small fact that Leonel was gay.Mitchell interrupted Draco’s silent musings.“Again, I stress how committed we are to Mr. Potter’s recovery and well-being. We’ll leave you with him now.”“Thank you, Healer Mitchell. We appreciate your efforts,” Granger replied.“Of course, Miss Granger.”Mitchell used her wand to move the two chairs closer to Potter’s bed and left the room with a brief smile. Leonel and Betty followed at her heels. Draco lingered behind, knowing he had to say something. He wanted to say something.“I promise you both that I’ll do everything I can to make sure Potter’s alright.”“Thanks, Draco,” Granger said softly. “We don’t doubt you.”“Yeah, thanks Malfoy.”Draco nodded, looked at Potter once more, and left. “You have all the equipment?”“Yes, Healer,” said Leonel monotonically. “Honestly, I’m not a trainee anymore. Can’t you trust me to keep track of these things?”“No. You’re still a lower rank than me, a year younger than me, and I’m your superior, which means I am ultimately and unfortunately responsible for you.”“There’s no need to treat me like a child,” Leonel muttered as he surely double-checked that he had all the equipment behind Draco’s back. “You have Betty for that.”“Betty’s no fun though. She’s too nice,” Draco explained, “So you’ll continue to be the one I pick on because there’s no one else.”“What about Ira? They’re even younger than me,” Leonel pointed out.“They’re powerful, smart, and wealthy. Only a fool would mess with Ira.”Leonel grunted in agreement. They continued walking, Draco reading over the potion screening and Leonel taking care not to drop anything.“Didn’t you use to go to school with Harry Potter?” Leonel asked, interrupting the silence.“Over eight years ago. I haven’t seen him in person since my trial,” Draco frowned, lowering his voice as he spoke.“And you know his friends, too.” It wasn’t framed like a question.“You already know the answer to that. You begged me to meet the visionary Hermione Granger a few times, remember?”“I still don’t know why you didn’t.”“The past is in the past,” said Draco, waving the subject away. “Anyway, you’re meeting her now. Isn’t that enough?”Leonel scoffed, affronted. “I think I have enough tact to not bring up my admiration at a time like this.”Draco knew he was right.They reached Potter’s room. Draco knocked on the door gently before opening it and getting welcomed by the sight of Weasley and Granger sitting by Potter, the latter holding his limp hand. Draco swallowed.“We’re ready to start the cleansing procedure. Unfortunately, I am going to have to ask you to leave. We can only ensure the best results if we’re sure there’s no distractions while we’re performing the procedure.”Weasley nodded and stood up, extending a hand down to Granger. She seemed more reluctant to leave, electing instead to grip Potter’s hand tighter.“Come on, Hermione. He’ll be fine. He always is.”She gazed at Potter for a second more with tired eyes, and finally nodded. Granger released Potter’s and took Weasley’s, and stood up shakily. They walked out the room together, Granger hanging onto Weasley as if for her life. Draco and Leonel glanced at each other.“Alright. Let’s get started.”They were almost done with the first stage of the process when Potter responded.“Wait,” Draco said sharply, surprising Leonel into freezing in his place. “I think he just moved.”Leonel lowered the vial of clear liquid he was holding and narrowed his eyes. “What did?”“His head. I think he turned it a bit,” Draco said hesitantly. “He might have made a noise, too.”“Should we stop?”“No, this is good. It will be easier to have him drink the Clearing Potion than having to force it down.”“Ok.” Leonel looked nervous but prepared. Draco recognized the glint in his dark eyes, determined to face whatever challenge was in front of him.Draco cleared his throat.“Potter? Can you hear me?” he said clearly, hoping Potter was conscious enough to understand him, and better yet, communicate. This was almost unheard of, but of course, Potter was exceptional. “I would like you to drink an important potion that will help get excess chemicals out of your body. If you can hear me, please move any part of your right hand.”Draco stared down at Potter’s hand, and felt Leonel’s eyes on it too. After a few more moments, there was a twitch of movement in Potter’s index finger. Leonel glanced at Draco with wide eyes.“Excellent.” Draco smiled a bit. “Now, Potter, this may burn a bit, but I assure you that it’s beneficial. Do you understand?”Another twitch.Draco’s smile grew.“Right, Leonel. Let him drink it.”Potter’s eyes were still closed, and his breaths were shallow, but he had confirmed that he could drink it. Leonel carefully tilted Potter’s head forward and tipped the vial into his open mouth. After ensuring that Potter had successfully swallowed it, Leonel laid his head back down on the pillow and put the empty vial away.“Good work, Potter,” Draco said clearly, nodding approvingly. He then addressed Leonel. “Now we just need to make sure it works. He should feel it in his system soon, perhaps a minute or two.”Leonel nodded, and Draco could see the anxiety in his face.They only waited for a minute and a half when Potter’s body tightened and clenched, his back going stiff and lifting several centimeters off the bed as he writhed. He yelled out, his hand curled into fist and face scrunched in pain.Draco quickly cast Muffliato in the direction of the door – no use in scaring the other patients and guests. Even Leonel looked frightened, though he was trying, unsuccessfully, to hide it from Draco.“It’ll be over soon,” Draco assured Leonel over Potter’s yells.Leonel nodded, his brows furrowed and impossibly perfect teeth worrying his bottom lip. Then, as soon as it started, the yelling stopped. Potter’s body relaxed and slowly fell back onto the mattress.Draco checked Potter’s vitals, and upon seeing that they were as stable as they could be at this stage, he told Leonel to pack it up. Leonel collected the equipment in his arms as Draco undid the muting spell. When he opened the door, he was greeted by Weasley’s and Granger’s equally worried faces. Draco gestured to Leonel, giving him permission to go. Leonel walked away.“The first stage has been completed,” Draco told them. “The second stage will take place tomorrow night, stage three two days after that, and after that he should be completely cleansed of all foreign chemicals that are currently in his body.”The couple relaxed visibly.“Do you know when he’ll wake up?” Weasley asked anxiously.“He was actually partly conscious while we were in there. He didn’t open his eyes or speak, but he did acknowledge what I was saying,” Draco said, slightly amused by how much Granger and Weasley were perking up. “Judging by this behavior, he might even wake up tomorrow morning, which is quite rare. I’m impressed, I must say.”Granger’s lips quivered slightly. “That’s wonderful.”“Thank you. Really, Malfoy,” Weasley said genuinely.Heartened by this show of faith, Draco took a chance.“I’m just doing my job. There’s also something I wanted to discuss with you two,” he paused. “I was wondering if I could ask you some questions regarding Potter’s history with potions.”This sobered them up rather quickly.Granger hesitated before asking lowly, “Could we go somewhere private?”Draco wasn’t surprised – this was clearly a sensitive topic and not to mention, had to do with Potter.“Of course,” he said. “My office is just down the corridor. Follow me.”He led them to his office, opening the door and allowing Granger and Weasley to enter and sit down first.“Right.” Draco sat down at his desk and took out Potter’s file. He looked up at Granger and Weasley, who both seemed rather reluctant. “You can begin anytime you’d like.”Draco dabbed his quill in his inkpot as Granger prepared her words.“Well,” she said cautiously. It was clear she hadn’t told this story before. “Harry taking potions isn’t anything new. He started taking Dreamless Sleep shortly after the war ended. But it was still an approved amount back then, and he only took it when necessary. But when he started training as an Auror, it got worse.”“I remember he’d come into work restless,” Weasley said, picking up where Granger left off. “Looking sort of drained, even though he told me he’d used Dreamless Sleep the night before. I reckon that’s when he started overusing it, to the point where it became a cycle. He’d come in, work his arse off, go home, do paperwork, take Dreamless Sleep, and go to bed. Every day.”“Do you know how long he did that?” Draco asked, continuing his notes as he spoke.“Maybe a year?” Weasley said uncertainly. “But that was before it got really bad. He could hardly get out of bed some days. And then Harry just stopped coming to work. Hermione and I went over to his flat, and he just said he was tired. It was halfway reasonable. I mean, I quit a few months later to work at my brother’s store.”Draco’s quill scratched furiously against the parchment.“Were you aware that he was taking potions other than Dreamless Sleep at the same time?”They both nodded.“We would go visit him sometimes, cos he hardly went out anymore.” Weasley frowned, remembering. “His flat was always a mess. Just – empty potion bottles everywhere. Most of them were Dreamless Sleep, but there were some others too.”“When did you start noticing these changes? The new potions?”Weasley looked over to Granger for help.“Around half a year after he quit Auror training. And that was…in June 2000.”Just a month after the second anniversary of the Battle of Hogwarts, Draco thought as he wrote it down.“So it was most likely around early 2001?”“Yes.” Granger sighed. “I wish I had the exact details down…how I didn’t think to remember everything before…”“This is already very helpful,” Draco reassured. Granger nodded, though she didn’t look too convinced. Draco pushed on. “Did you ever notice Potter drinking excessively?”Weasley shifted in his seat, clearly uncomfortable.“Sometimes, when we’d go over to his flat, everything smelled like alcohol. And when we told him he might want to stop, he shrugged it off.”Draco nodded. “And I don’t suppose you have an estimation as to when that started.”“Later on. When Harry started getting more desperate – when the potions weren’t working as well – he started drinking,” Granger said, looking pained. “Last year. Spring of 2004.”As Draco wrote this down, he spoke again.“I apologize for having to ask you all of these questions, especially at a time like this. I understand it’s a sensitive topic.”Granger shook her head.“If it helps, we’ll do anything.” Draco woke the next morning with his face pressed against his notes. He sat up slowly, back aching terribly from having spent the night hunched over his desk.He blinked at the sunlight coming in though the blinds, eyes adjusting to the harsh light that woke him up before unsticking the notes from his cheek. Draco checked his wristwatch – it was barely six in the morning.He stood up and stretched, checking the mirror to evaluate the damage. His hair was sticking up on one side and his robes were wrinkled. But at least there was no ink on his face.“Take a shower,” his mirror suggested.“You think I wouldn’t if I could?” Draco grumbled.He smoothed his hair down and took out the spare robes he kept in his office. He quickly replaced his wrinkled robes with the fresh ones.Satisfied, Draco stuck his wand in his pocket and opened his door. He was immediately welcomed by the slightly interested (or rather interested, by their standards) face of Ira White. Ira, head of the Aletta Wellensly ward of the same department, was lanky, as blond as Draco, and genderfluid.“Ira,” Draco greeted.“Is it true? Harry Potter’s here?” Ira asked calmly.“Yes.” Draco frowned. “Who told you?”“Betty. She tells me everything, so don’t punish her for it.”“I won’t,” Draco sighed. “I just hope you don’t tell anyone, because it’s supposed to be kept under wraps. The last thing we need here is a team of Prophet reporters, and Merlin forbid, Rita bloody Skeeter.”“Oh, I wouldn’t tell anyone. It’s just, you know, I’m ridiculously bored after submitting my new potions in for approval by the Ministry. I’ve nothing to do.”They looked hopefully at Draco, and he sighed again.“Fine. If he’s still asleep, and if there aren’t any guests in his room, I’ll let you in. Only for a second, though. If anyone asks, you’re doing something with potions.”“Aren’t I always?”They made their way to Potter’s room. Draco lightly knocked on the door before opening the door and peering in. Potter looked about the same as he did yesterday, though perhaps he had some more color in his face. Draco let Ira in.They whistled lowly. “Five years of silence and then this.”“He’ll be ok,” Draco said quietly. “I’ll make sure of it.”And then Potter woke with a gasp, eyes wide and face covered in sweat.

Chapter Text
White ceiling. White walls.He shouldn’t have sat up so fast. Harry pressed his palm to his forehead and shut his eyes, trying to distract himself from the lightheadedness.“Lie back down, Potter,” said an urgent voice, somewhat familiar.Harry lowered his hand and opened his eyes partially, squinting at the slightly blurry figure in front of him. They were walking forward with arms extended towards him, like they were going to grab him.“Lie down,” the voice said again. “You’re safe.”Head pounding, Harry groaned. Maybe he should lie back down. He lowered himself back down and closed his eyes, letting sleep take him once more. When he woke next, Harry felt slightly better.He didn’t make the same mistake of sitting up right away, and instead felt around for his glasses. They were on the bedside table; he put them on and observed his surroundings.St Mungo’s. Of course.Harry sighed, vaguely relieved that he had gotten here. Although he didn’t remember much of the past few days, he did remember that he had really wanted (needed?) to get to St Mungo’s.He then realized someone else was in the room – a Healer, in lime green robes.“Malfoy?” Harry croaked, throat aching from lack of use.“Healer Malfoy, Potter,” Malfoy said, confirming his identity.Malfoy stepped closer and before Harry could react, cast several spells on him. There was a warm sensation in his chest and he watched as various numbers and lines rose into the air above him.“Good,” Malfoy muttered to himself. Harry watched, mind hazy and unable to cooperate as Malfoy wrote on his papers. He returned his attention to Harry. “Your vital signs are improving. Would you like some water?”Harry nodded and drank down the glass of water Malfoy had handed to him. Once he gave it back to Malfoy, he said, “Sorry, did you say Healer?”“Yes, I did,” Malfoy said, his face rather expressionless. “Do you feel any pain?”“No, I’m just sort of dizzy. Since when?” Harry asked, unable to make sense of what was happening.Malfoy exhaled impatiently.“You know, if I were you, I’d be more concerned about my health than my Healer. Did you know that you were unconscious for at least fifteen hours? Or that your system was overridden by an unsafe number of potions, and not to mention, alcohol? You’re incredibly lucky you were found, Potter. I hate to think what would have happened if you were left in that state all night –“Harry was barely listening. His curiosity was rapidly turning into annoyance, and his brain wasn’t nearly as hazy as before. Why was he here anyway? Sure, he might’ve wanted to come here a day ago (or whenever that was), but he was fine now, wasn’t he?“Right, I get it,” Harry interrupted, causing Malfoy’s grey eyes to narrow. “When can I leave?”“Leave?” Malfoy repeated incredulously. “You need to stay here for two days at the very least, so we can finish treating you. Potter, I don’t think you understand how grave this situation is.”Harry was starting to get a headache.“Where’s my wand, Malfoy?”“You’ll get it back once you’ve completed treatment,” Malfoy said, his voice calm once more.“I won’t be completing anything,” Harry shot back, his annoyance growing exponentially. Harry advanced on Malfoy, his lightheadedness forgotten in his anger. Harry gripped the front of Malfoy’s green robes and looked him square in the eye. “You let me the fuck out of here now.”Malfoy looked at Harry impassively. “I’ll advise you to lie back down, Potter.”“Or what?” Harry challenged.Before Malfoy could respond, two Healers burst in the room with shocked expressions on their faces.“Mr. Potter, please!” one of them said, pulling Harry away from Malfoy and pushing him back towards the bed with the help of the second individual.Harry knew when to give up and conceded, sitting down and gritting his teeth, blood rushing to his head and making him dizzy once more.One of the Healers, a tall, lanky individual, shook their hair from their face and exhaled. There was a small shiny badge on the front of their robes, which read 'Ira White - they/them.'“I’m Healer White, and I’ll be assisting Healer Malfoy in keeping you here,” White said pleasantly. They regarded Harry and frowned. “I do hope you’ll behave.”Harry didn’t respond.The other Healer was a young woman with a long, black braid and white Healer robes – perhaps she was of a lower rank. Her badge simply read ‘Bethia Burke.’“Are you alright, Healer?” she asked quietly.“Just peachy,” replied Malfoy. “Thanks, Betty.”“Of course, Healer Malfoy,” Burke said. “Erm, I brought a sedative. Should I administer it?”“No, we’re trying to help Potter recover; he doesn’t need any chemicals in his system.”“Right, of course.”“Recover?” Harry asked, voice loud and harsh.Malfoy looked pointedly at him. “Yes, Potter, recover. As I’ve said before, we must help you flush out the potions in your system. And then we’ll be helping you stop taking said potions and curb your addiction.”Harry glared at Malfoy. Who did he think he was, forcing Harry to stay here and saying he had an addiction?“What are you talking about?” Harry growled.“Oh.” Malfoy seemed troubled. He turned to the girl, Betty. “Inform Miss Granger and Mr. Weasley that Potter has woken up. I believe they went home for the night so you’ll have to fire-call them.”“Yes, Healer Malfoy.”Harry felt a deep pain settle in his chest. Ron and Hermione. Had they seen him like this, unconscious and helpless in a hospital bed?How could he have let this happen to himself? Although, he thought, some part of him had wanted this, right? Fine, he was in trouble last night – he could admit that. But he didn’t need to stay here and “recover.” He just needed to get back on his feet and get out as soon as possible. He felt nauseous just thinking about the media getting ahold of this – Harry Potter reemerges in St. Mungo’s after…how many years was it now?Trembling, Harry shook his head.“I have to go. I can’t stay here.” His voice betrayed him by wavering slightly. “Just give me the treatment and I’ll do it myself. At home. But I can’t stay here.”Malfoy and White stared at him with identical expressions: worry. He couldn’t stand it. He’d had enough years of people just staring at him, watching him, needing him, asking things of him.“Please. Just let me go.”“It’s a complicated process,” Malfoy said carefully, “And almost impossible to do on oneself. It would be much safer and effective if experienced Healers treated you.”Harry glanced worriedly at the window facing out the hallway. White walked over and shut the blinds.“No one will see you,” White said, voice gentler than Harry had ever heard it. “And anyways, they’re false windows. Nothing out there but brick.”“And nobody will know you’re here, either. Healer White and I will make sure nobody outside of this department knows, alright?”Harry nodded. It was a little easier to breathe.“Two days?”“Minimum,” Malfoy said, lips twisting into a frown.“Fine,” Harry grumbled.He crawled back under the covers and took off his glasses, wanting to sleep and forget everything. It turned out, however, that he couldn’t sleep.Harry tossed and turned repeatedly, growing increasingly irritated as time passed. Finally, he gave up and chose instead to stare at the ceiling.It was an hour and a half of staring before Hermione and Ron came into the room.“Harry,” Hermione whispered as she approached.Ron was behind her, dreadfully pale.Harry felt a flurry of emotions at once – joy at seeing them, embarrassment that it was like this, guilt that they looked so upset. He’d caused them so much trouble.“Hermione, Ron,” Harry said, his voice scratchy. He didn’t even know what to say. “I’m – I’m so sorry.”“No, mate, we’re the ones who are sorry,” Ron said lowly.“Harry,” Hermione said again tearfully. “We should’ve tried harder to help you.”Harry shook his head. “I didn’t want to be helped.”And I still don’t want to be, thought Harry stubbornly.“Oh, Harry,” Hermione said, tears now falling down her cheeks as she rushed to hug him. Harry hugged her tightly, breathing in her scent and feeling the shudder of her shoulders and the strength of her arms wrapped around him. “We love you so much and it just – hurts so much to see you like this, to have been seeing you like this, and to know that we’ve been so useless.” “I love you too,” Harry said quietly as they parted, though Hermione kept a hand on his arm. “And you’re not useless. None of this is your fault.”Harry looked away, afraid he was going to start crying. Hermione must have sensed this, because she gripped his arm tighter.“Harry, mate…we’re always here for you,” Ron said. “Through thick and thin. No matter what.”“I know, Ron,” Harry said, biting his lip. “Thanks, mate. Really.”They all sat in silence for a bit, Harry still staring at the opposite wall for fear of breaking down (he would not let that happen – he couldn’t). Finally, Hermione cleared her throat.“I’ll let the Healers know you’re awake.”Harry nodded. He heard Hermione mutter the Patronus charm and felt the unmistakable warmth appear and disappear. They were only waiting a few minutes before there was a soft knock at the door.Finally, Harry turned to meet the gazes of everyone in the room – Hermione, Ron, Malfoy, and the girl from earlier, Betty?He finally had a chance to get a look at Malfoy without feeling like he might pass out or burst from anger. He’d grown in the past five years and held himself with more confidence (still not quite up to par with his Hogwarts days, though). His hair was growing loosely around his pale face, and there were bags underneath his grey eyes. Malfoy met his gaze evenly.“I’m glad to see you’re awake, Potter.”He was holding the same papers he had had earlier that day. Betty was at his heels, carrying what looked like a hospital gown.“I’ve brought you a clean set of hospital robes, Mr. Potter,” Betty said as she set it down carefully at the foot of his bed. She then placed a plastic bag on top – there was something in it. His hoodie, probably. “You can put the clothing you’re wearing in there for now.”Harry nodded.Malfoy stepped closer and drew his wand. “I’m going to check your vitals now.” And he did so, staring with great intensity at the numbers and lines and then scribbling his observations onto his paper.“You’re improving quickly, and I must say I’m impressed,” Malfoy said begrudgingly. He checked the time, glancing at a silver watch on his thin wrist. “Your heart rate is still too fast, but that’s to be expected. I’d like to ask you a series of questions to evaluate how you’re doing, alright? I can ask Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger to leave if you’d like.”Harry looked at them; their interest was thinly veiled.“No, that’s alright. They can stay.”Ron gave Harry a small smile.“Do you have a headache?”“I had one earlier,” Harry said, “But it’s mostly gone now.”“Any nausea?”Harry shook his head.“Do you feel anxious?”Harry resisted the urge to laugh. He felt anxious all the time, except perhaps when he was on calming potions.“As usual.”Malfoy frowned. “Have you ever been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder?”“No.”“We’ll look into that.” Malfoy wrote something down. “Well, it seems you have the typical symptoms of withdrawal from calming potions and alcohol, so you shouldn’t be too worried. If you experience any more severe symptoms, alert a Healer right away.”“What would the severe symptoms be?” Hermione asked cautiously.Malfoy glanced over to her, his eyebrows furrowed.“Keep in mind that these are called severe for a reason, but…they can include panic attacks, hallucinations, seizures, and suicidal ideation.”Hermione’s eyes were wide and Ron looked a bit sick. Harry, however, had dealt with most of these ‘severe symptoms’ before, so he wasn’t too worried.“We of course have spells set up to alert us if Potter’s having a seizure,” Malfoy said, mostly to Hermione and Ron. He frowned at them a bit more before turning to Betty. “Could you preform the Foreign-Identifier Spell? I’d like to check the progress of the cleansing procedure.”Betty nodded and took out a notepad and quill from her pockets.“You won’t feel anything,” she told Harry as she then took out a wand. “Indica Externa.”Harry watched as a short list appeared in front of him. Betty began copying down the floating words with great speed; Hermione and Ron looked interestedly at it, the former moving closer to get a better look.“Excellent,” Malfoy murmured, his eyes also on the list.“It’s so much shorter than before,” Betty commented after she finished.Malfoy nodded.“So this means the cleansing procedure is working?” Hermione asked hopefully.“It does. All of the numbers have significantly been reduced,” Malfoy answered. He spoke to Betty as Hermione and Ron hugged. “Run it by Leonel, just to make sure.”“Yes, Healer Malfoy.”Betty left the room, her long braid trailing behind her.“Congratulations, Potter,” Malfoy said to Harry. “You’re on the way to recovery. But before I let you rest, I need you to answer some more questions.Harry stiffened. “What kind of questions?”“I think you know what kind,” Malfoy said, actually sounding a bit sorry, “And I wouldn’t be asking if I really didn’t need to know in order to treat you.”Harry glanced at his friends; they were looking at him in the way he imagined worried parents would.“Fine.”“Good,” said Malfoy. “Once again, Mr. Weasley and Miss Granger can either stay or leave – it’s up to you.”He knew the answer before Malfoy even asked – he grimaced apologetically at them and hoped they would understand.“Good luck, mate,” Ron said, clapping Harry on the back. He glanced over at Malfoy, then back at Harry. “And don’t kill him.”“We’ll be right outside.” Hermione gave him a small smile.“Thanks.”Both Harry and Malfoy watched them leave. His eyesight caught on Malfoy – he was watching him with a somber face, making Harry feel even more uncomfortable than before.“Well, let’s get this over with,” Harry said, choosing to stare at his hands instead of Malfoy’s annoying piteous face. “What do you want to know?”“Your friends have already told me a few details regarding your potions abuse –““Abuse?” Harry interrupted, shocked into looking up at Malfoy, who stood, unsurprised. “That’s not – I’m not – that’s mental.”“Potter, I’m sorry to have to tell you this, but in my professional opinion, you do have a potions addiction,” he said calmly, “And we at St. Mungo’s are fully committed to helping you recover from it. But first, you need to focus on answering these questions and not interrupting me, if you please.”Harry didn’t feel inclined to believe him but he sat back and shut his mouth anyways.“As I was saying, I only have a vague timeline so far, and I’d like to fill it out in order to better understand you,” he paused, waiting to see if Harry would stop him. When he didn’t, Malfoy continued, “Granger and Weasley have told me you started taking dreamless sleep when you began Auror training and it escalated about a year into taking them. This would place us around 1999. Is this correct?”Harry nodded.“You then quit training mid-2000, and began taking additional potions around 2001. This then takes us to spring of 2004 – last year – when alcohol also became a prominent part of your life. Is that also correct?”Perhaps it did sound worse when spoken aloud, but Harry still thought it was extreme to say he had an addiction.He nodded.Malfoy looked him square in the eye.“Obviously, stopping the intake of all of these drugs would be the opposite of beneficial, so we’ve been cleansing your bloodstream of all the alcohol and potions that are present in this moment. It won’t take away years of damage, but it will give you a partially clean slate.“After we’ve completed the cleansing procedure, we’ll focus on the psychological effects of your addiction.” Malfoy said, seeming to sense that Harry was about to interrupt with a denial. “It’s nothing to be ashamed of. The Healers at St. Mungo’s are completely prepared to treat you both physically and mentally through outsourcing. There’ve been changes made in the recent years so we’re better able to treat our patients and fulfill all their needs. You are not the first to come here needing addiction treatment, Potter, and you won’t be the last.”Harry could hardly believe this arrogant prat was telling him all of this so matter-of-factly, telling him that he had an addiction. The absurdity of it all caught up with Harry’s irritation and the words he’d been holding back burst out.“I don’t –““Yes,” Malfoy cut across him sternly, his face twitching momentarily from its usual expressionlessness, “You do. The first step is acceptance, Potter, and you’ll soon complete it.”“Fuck off, Malfoy. You don’t know shit about me,” Harry growled, wanting to scare Malfoy into showing some sort of emotion – anything other than this infuriating blank stare he was currently getting.It barely worked.Malfoy just took a deep breath and took a step closer.“My job is to learn about you so I can effectively treat you,” he said, his voice probably meant to be calming. “I know we haven’t had the best of pasts – “Harry scoffed. “- but I am committed to learning what’s necessary for your treatment. And I believe I know enough about you to realize that you are a strong and determined individual. If anyone can fight addiction, it’s you.”Harry couldn’t think of anything to say. Malfoy frowned and crossed his arms.“Well,” Malfoy said, his voice a little less even now, “The first thing we’re going to do is cut alcohol completely. You’re going to feel the withdrawal symptoms peak in about a day, but it’s important that you don’t drink a drop. Do you understand?”Malfoy seemed to be forgetting something.“I’ll be gone in two days,” Harry mumbled. “How are you going to monitor me after that?”“I’m hoping you’ll consent to staying here a bit longer. It would highly increase your chances of recovery, as there’s nothing for you to relapse on here. And, if you begin to feel more severe symptoms, you can receive almost instant care.”He frowned at Harry, who was still feeling rather resentful.“Think on it, at least.” Malfoy took his wand out and checked Harry’s vitals again. “Your heart rate has accelerated a bit. How are you feeling now?”“Sort of nauseous,” Harry bit out. “Not that bad.”“The bathroom is just a few steps away, but if you feel you can’t make it, there’s a bucket at the side of your bed.” Malfoy gestured towards it. “I’ll leave you to rest now. Healer Estrada and I will be in tomorrow morning to do step two of the cleansing process, but if you need anyone before then, don’t hesitate to alert us.”“Healer Estrada?”“You haven’t met him yet,” Malfoy said, “But I assure you that you can trust him.”“Fine.”Malfoy studied him for a moment longer before taking his leave. A minute later, Ron and Hermione reentered.“How was it?” Hermione asked tentatively.“Fine,” Harry sighed. “Malfoy just asked me to double-check the dates you gave him. When’d you talk to him?”“Last night,” Ron supplied. “We just went in his office and answered his questions. Erm…was everything alright?”“It’s Malfoy,” Harry said, and that should have been answer enough.Though, according to the way Hermione and Ron glanced at each other, it wasn’t.“Mate…he’s really changed,” Ron said slowly. “And I hated the git when we were in Hogwarts. We all did, you know that. But he’s different now. He’s a Healer – doesn’t that say something?”Harry shrugged. “Healers make money.”“There are other ways to make money, Harry,” Hermione said. “Draco wants to help people.”“Oh, he’s Draco to you now?”For a second, it looked like Hermione was going to say something. She decided against it, however, and simply sighed.“Harry, please just give him a chance. From what I’ve heard, he’s an excellent Healer and very committed to helping you. This whole department is.”Harry scoffed. “Whatever.”“You ­need this, Harry,” Hermione said firmly. When Harry rolled his eyes, she continued, her voice stern. “You need help. And some part of you knows that. Why would you have come here otherwise?”Harry stared down at his hands. Why did he come here?The headache was coming back.“Look –“But he was interrupted by a knock at the door. It opened a second later and in came someone Harry didn’t know. She was tall – her heels adding to her height, and had a well-practiced smile.“Mr. Potter. I’m sorry to interrupt but I just wanted to introduce myself to you as I haven’t gotten a chance yet. I’m Scarlett Mitchell, the Healer-in-Charge of the Potion and Plant Poisoning department.”“Er, nice to meet you. And it’s no problem.”“It’s good to see you again, Mr. Weasley and Ms. Granger.”“Likewise,” said Ron.“I understand Healer Malfoy is attending to you with some help from the other Healers. They’ll take excellent care of you,” Mitchell said to Harry. “It has also come to my attention that you’d rather keep your stay here confidential, which, of course, is something we can do. I trust all of my employees that are in your care, and that this room will be sufficient in keeping your identity hidden. However, if you’re not comfortable enough in here, it would be no trouble to move you.”“Oh, no, that’s fine,” Harry assured uncomfortably. “I don’t plan on being here for much longer anyway so I wouldn’t want to cause trouble. Thanks, Healer Mitchell.”Mitchell’s eyebrows drew together for just a second, but she quickly regained her composure.“Of course. I’ll take my leave now, but if anyone needs anything, my office is just down the hall and to the right.”They nodded and thanked her, and Mitchell left. The three of them were quiet for a moment before Hermione took the smallest step forward.“Harry, are you sure you don’t want to stay a bit longer? I feel like you’ll be able to overcome this much easier if you stayed here,” she said in her suggesting-not-demanding voice.“I won’t buy any more drinks or potions, and I’ll bin the ones I have at home. If you don’t believe me, you can come over and do it yourselves,” Harry replied.Hermione suppressed a sigh.“I reckon you can’t quit that soon. You’d have to drink a little bit of potion every day before you stop completely. Y’know, lower the amount a bit until it’s nothing,” Ron piped up, “Cos just cutting it out would be dangerous. But regulating it would be hard on your own.”Harry looked at him, surprised he knew so much about this. Hermione was also staring at him.“What?” he said defensively, taking in their expressions. “My dad’s uncle abused potions when I was a kid.”“Sorry, Ron. I didn’t realize you had so much second-hand experience with this,” Hermione said quickly.“Yeah, well, I do,” Ron said uncomfortable. He turned to speak to Harry again. “Point is you should stay here so you can do it properly. Then you can leave.”“But if that’s true,” said Harry as something occurred to him, “Why are they doing the cleansing thing?”“There were two ingredients that had the potential to be deadly when mixed,” Hermione explained. “I’m sure that’s why they had to perform the cleansing procedure.”“What, and then I get put back on potions?” Harry asked, irritation bubbling up in him once more.“Ask Draco about it later tonight,” Hermione told him. Ron nodded, eyes flashing from Harry to Hermione and back. “He’ll clear it up. He’s the Healer, after all.”Harry nodded slowly, still wary about it all. And then he remembered something strange.“When’d you start calling Malfoy by his first name, anyway?”“Since we started spending more time with him,” Hermione said. At Harry’s bewildered face, she elaborated. “When we go out with Ginny and Blaise, when they’re in town, anyway, Draco’s also there sometimes.”“Oh,” Harry said, unsure of what to think.It wasn’t their fault. Harry had been the one who shut himself in and pushed everyone away. Ron and Hermione had invited him out countless times, he’d just been too fucked up to actually go – either mentally or physically. Or both.God, but it was weird thinking about the four of them drinking amicably and being on first-name basis with each other. Was it really that easy moving on?“Harry?” Ron asked, snapping him out of his thoughts. “You alright, mate?”“Er, yeah – sorry,” Harry mumbled.Ron’s eyes were concerned but he nodded anyway. His gaze drifted over to the clock on the wall.“You should probably be getting back to work,” Ron said softly to Hermione.She, too, looked at the clock and sighed.“You’re right,” she said. “Harry, I’m sorry. I wouldn’t leave if I didn’t have to.”“I know, Hermione,” Harry replied. “Go on, it’s fine.”She touched his hand once more. “We’ll see you tomorrow.”“Get some rest.”“Thank you,” Harry said, and watched the two of them leave.He felt foolish, like an irresponsible baby who couldn’t handle himself in the real world. Harry sat up for a while longer, waiting for someone else to come in.When no one else did, Harry stood up shakily. He grabbed the bag (his hoodie was in there) and hospital robes and went to the bathroom. It was small, predictably, with a shower, sink, mirror, and toilet. Harry put the items down on the closed toilet and started by peeling off his shirt (how many days had he been wearing it?).Harry caught his shirtless reflection in the mirror and stared, transfixed. When was the last time he’d really looked in the mirror? Merlin, he looked bad. No wonder he avoided his own reflection. He trailed his hand down his own chest; he was thinner – though he always was thanks to the Dursleys – and his skin didn’t have its previous healthy color. Heavy bags were underneath his dead eyes, and even his hair seemed to be less animated.He took his glasses off to wash his face, though it barely made any difference. Take a bloody shower, scowled a voice within him, but he couldn’t. Even this took too much effort.With a sigh, he finished changing into the white hospital robes. If anyone saw him now, there’d be no doubt he was a patient here at St. Mungo’s. Hopefully the staff could keep their promises and keep his being here private.Harry gathered his clothes and stuffed them in the bag, which he then tied tightly. He made his way back to the bed, dropping the bag next to the sick bucket as he sat down. A headache was coming on, and though he’d like to sleep it off, he already knew that he wouldn’t be able to. He settled into bed regardless. There was a knock at the door around 10 pm. Malfoy walked in with his clipboard and a Healer Harry hadn’t seen before. He was ridiculously handsome with his thick dark hair and bright eyes.“Sorry to come so late, Potter, but we’ve got the second cleansing step to complete,” Malfoy said. He nodded towards the new Healer. “That’s Healer Leonel Estrada, who’ll be assisting me. Healer, this is –““Harry Potter, of course,” Estrada interrupted. Malfoy rolled his eyes at this, but Estrada didn’t seem to notice. He smiled, revealing his startlingly white teeth. “Great to meet you, Mr. Potter. I wish it were under better circumstances, of course…”“Likewise,” Harry responded.Malfoy cleared his throat. Harry turned to look at him.“Before we begin, I’d like to ask how you’re feeling.”“I’ve had a headache for a while now, and I’m a bit tired, but other than that…”Malfoy was writing on his clipboard again. It was a peculiar sight.“Did you sleep at all?”“No.” Harry shook his head. “I tried, but no.”Malfoy nodded. “Withdrawal from both alcohol and calming potions will affect your sleep rather severely, I’m afraid. Because there’ll be no more risk of death after today’s procedure, we’ll administer a basic calming potion afterwards to aid in you retaining a regular sleeping schedule. It won’t be too strong, of course, but you do need something in your system.”So Ron was right. He sighed, then looked at Malfoy.“Well? Go ahead then.”

Chapter Text
Draco was looking through his notes again when there was a brisk knock at the door.“Come in,” he called out, not looking up from his parchment.The door opened and a second later, Leonel was seated at the corner of his desk.“Did you spend the night again?”“It’s none of your business,” Draco said, feeling his brows furrow.“That’s a yes, then,” Leonel said more cheekily than Draco would’ve liked.“What are you doing here, Leo?” Draco sighed, finally looking him in the eye.Leo frowned at him a bit but kept his tone light and concentrated on a paperweight he’d picked up from Draco’s desk.“Just wanted to make sure you weren’t overworking yourself, though you obviously are.”“Well-spotted.”“Jesus, Draco,” Leonel said. He put the paperweight down. “Forgive me for caring about your health.”Draco looked down at his notes again, uncomfortable. “I can take care of myself. I know my limits. I’m just – focused on this bloody case.”“Mr. Potter?”“What else?” Draco muttered. And then the thoughts that had been running through his head flew out of his mouth before he could stop them. “Merlin, I never thought I’d see him again, which was foolish of me in hindsight, I suppose, but like this? He was meant to marry Ginevra and have a whole clan of little red-headed monsters, not…”Leonel put a hand on Draco’s shoulder, his face solemn. Draco tensed infinitesimally but let it stay there, allowing himself to briefly enjoy the feel of physical contact from another person.It’d been almost a year since Leonel and he had broken up, and Draco hadn’t gotten close to another person since.It was short-lived but intense; it began when they spent Leonel’s first few months at St. Mungo’s flirting nonstop (he’d transferred from a wizarding hospital in the States). They could barely keep their hands off each other, taking advantage of every possible moment they had free. They thrived off each other’s wit and passion, their ability to talk about the same subject with each other for ages, and how they could have sex multiple times a day before finally tiring. Predictably, though, their relationship had fizzled out after six months, leaving them good friends and better colleagues.It was for the best, Draco had decided. He was Leonel’s superior, after all. Even though they hadn’t breached their employment contracts, Draco knew very well that dating one’s junior wasn’t his smartest decision.Draco shook himself out of his reverie and cleared his throat; Leonel took his hand back.“It’s fine,” Draco told Leonel (and himself). “It’s not like we were ever close.”“I got that, somehow. You never did talk much about Harry Potter, did you?”“It’s…complicated,” Draco admitted. “The –““War, yes,” Leonel finished for him. “I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to drudge up such an uncomfortable subject.”“It’s not your fault,” Draco said, dismissing it with a wave of his hand. “It can hardly be avoided with Potter here in the ward. You’re lucky you were on the other side of the world for it all.”“Hm,” Leonel agreed.After a few more moments, he stood, studying Draco with his dark eyes.“Well,” Leonel said, his voice soft. “You can go home, if you want. I’ll cover for you, and Selina has morning shift too. You don’t have anything scheduled that we can’t do, right?”“No, I suppose not,” Draco said. He managed a slight smile, appreciative of his concern. “Thank you, Leonel. I’ll be back for Potter’s cleansing later.”“I know. Just get some actual sleep in an actual bed.” Draco had to admit that he did he feel better after sleeping in his bed for the first time in two nights. It was a step up from his desk, and Draco woke up feeling relatively refreshed considering he’d only slept four hours. And it was only ten – excellent. He had enough time to shower and make a quick breakfast before heading back to work.He did so, savoring the way the hot water pounded on his knotted shoulders. He exited his bathroom after clothing himself, pushing his damp hair out of his face as he made his way to the kitchen. His one-bedroom flat was certainly different than his childhood home, but he liked it very much. It’d become home after all these years, and Merlin knew Draco needed a new one.With his father in prison and his mother spending most of her time in France, the Manor stood empty. Draco went to retrieve old texts or even keepsakes from time to time, and he and his mother spent Christmas holiday in it, but otherwise, it was deserted. There were too many ghosts to render it habitable, in Draco’s opinion.When he’d finished his tea and toast, Draco gathered his things and Apparated back to his office, feeling slightly more prepared for what was in store for today. In fact, all was well until noon.Draco had filled out paperwork for a patient that would be discharged later that day – a young woman who’d been brought in late last night. Her friend had supposedly been “helping her” by spiking her drink Befuddlement Draught. She defended herself, saying she just wanted to push her in the right direction, though instead of a push, she’d given her friend a shove.He was on his way to do one final check on the witch in question when one of the Healers in his department stopped him.“Oh! Healer Malfoy.”“Healer Lloyd, good morning.”Selina Lloyd was a plump, good-natured witch who was brilliant with potions. Draco had always liked her – she treated him kindly even when he’d first started at St. Mungo’s, when he was a pariah of sorts.“Good morning,” Selina said, and then lowered her voice. “That was Harry Potter I saw two nights ago, wasn’t it? How is he?”“Has no one really told you?” Draco asked, and when Selina shook her head, he was slightly surprised. “This must be the first time they’ve actually kept their bloody mouths shut. Yes, he’s here, but he’s asked us to keep his presence under wraps. No reporters, no fans, and absolutely no Prophet.”“I understand, of course,” Selina said. Draco motioned for her to follow, and she did, speaking quietly as they walked. “I was just so shocked when I’d stumbled upon his body! Not every day you see the Chosen One passed out on the sidewalk, is it?”“No, it isn’t.”“What happened to him?”“I’m surprised you haven’t been assigned to the case.”“You, Leo, and Betty? You three are more than enough.”Draco grimaced; it didn’t feel like they were. “I hope so. He overdosed on a combination of calming potions, sleeping potions, and alcohol.”Selina stopped in her tracks, and Draco paused too. She resumed her pace straight-away, though her face was white.“Merlin’s beard.”“Yes, it’s – it’s bad,” Draco concluded weakly.“I never would have imagined! That’s horrible.”“I don’t think anyone ever did.”They made it to the young witch’s room and stood to the side of the closed door.“All right. Well, I’ll leave you to it,” she said glumly. She patted his shoulder. “You’ll be fine, Draco.”“Thanks, Selina,” he said, feeling that he really wouldn’t.The check-up was quick and Draco discharged her confidently, reminding her to be careful with her drinks (and friends).Once he saw her off to the receptionists’ desk, he sent a Patronus to Leonel, asking to meet with him so they could discuss Potter. Leonel’s Rottweiler came bounding back a minute later, telling him that he was in the faculty lounge.Draco made his way over to the longue and greeted Betty and Leonel, who were chatting and snacking. They looked up as they entered, Betty subconsciously straightening her back.“Good morning, Healer Malfoy,” she chirped.“You look a lot better. I told you,” Leonel smirked, well past trying to impress him.“Thank you, Healer Estrada,” Draco said, though a smile tugged at his lips. “I’m assuming you’ve gone to check in on Potter?”“Of course,” said Leonel. “The entire hospital didn’t fall apart in the, what, five hours you’ve been gone?”“We checked on him at seven and again an hour ago. He’s doing as well as can be expected,” Betty said once Leonel had finished his bit. “His vitals are fine, considering, but he’s shaking terribly and he said he vomited a few times during the night. It’s all in his file.”“We gave him a Nourishing Potion since he’s been vomiting so much,” added Leonel seriously. “He’s dehydrated and isn’t maintaining nutrients.”Draco rubbed at his forehead. “All right, thanks. I’ll go see him.”When he entered the room, Potter glared at him tiredly from his bed.Whatever progress he had made in the past day was gone, it seemed – Potter looked nearly as bad as he did when he first came in. He was covered in a thin sheen of sweat with heavy bags under his eyes, his hair greasy and unkempt. The ends of his hair curled and stuck to his cheeks. And then, as if to greet Draco, Potter promptly vomited into the bucket at the side of his bed.Draco walked over and Vanished the contents wordlessly, averting his gaze and trying to remind himself that Potter had a right to hate him at this moment. He shuddered to think what it would be like if the tables were turned.Potter wiped his mouth roughly with the back of his hand.“Good morning, Potter,” he said, retrieving the file from where it hung on the end of his bed.Looking it over, he saw that Betty had taken care to list all the symptoms Potter had been suffering, and was relieved to see that they were all byproducts of withdrawal.“I bet you’re having a good laugh, aren’t you, Malfoy?” Potter goaded weakly as he lay back on his bed. He closed his eyes. “This must be bloody hilarious.”“I assure you that it’s quite the opposite, Potter,” Draco replied, taking care to keep his tone professional and neutral. “This is no laughing matter.”“Christ, loosen up, will you? You’re like a fucking robot.”Draco admittedly had a weak understanding of robots and chose to disregard this comment. Instead, he checked Potter’s vitals, ensuring that they were unchanged.“How many times have you vomited since my colleagues were here to check on you?”“Twice, I reckon,” Potter grumbled, opening his eyes to squint at Draco. “This is meant to be me healing, yeah?”“Recovering, yes,” Draco said. “Withdrawal from these certain substances can lead to everything you’re feeling now. It will be difficult now, but you’ll be the better for it later.”“How much later?”“Give or take a week. Now, I should add that these are only the physical symptoms. The emotional and mental effects withdrawal has will be cared outside of St. Mungo’s. We’ve got an extensive list of verified Mind-Healers who can tend to your needs.”Potter gave a hollow laugh.“Right, my needs.”Draco pushed forward. “We’re very committed to helping you. You just have to let us.”“Well, you only have a day left, so best of luck.”Draco gritted his teeth, reminding himself that Potter was a patient, a sick patient.“I still recommend that you stay longer to give you the best chances at a full recovery. It’s just not possible if you leave tomorrow.”Potter shrugged.“Look, Potter,” Draco ground out, “I realize that this isn’t an optimal situation, what with me being me and you being you, but when it comes down to it, I am your Healer. It is my job to look after your health and to help you. There’s a reason I’m head of this ward, and there’s a reason I’ve been assigned to you. I have an extensive knowledge of potions and poisons, and –““Yeah, I’m sure nearly killing two people is great experience,” Potter interrupted, his voice harsh. “Has everyone else here poisoned innocent people too, or are you just special, Malfoy?”Draco blanched, feeling cold wash over him. Potter watched him as he exhaled shakily.“There’s no excuse for what I did,” he said lowly. “I live with the consequences of my actions every day, Potter, and I’ll never let myself forget it even if I could.”“That sounds awful, Malfoy. Really. My heart aches for you.”Draco cleared his throat and looked away. “I can talk to my superior and see that I have this case reassigned to Healer Estrada so there’s no conflict of interest.”“There’s no need. I’ll be gone in a day.”“No, you won’t!” Draco finally exploded, turning to glare at Potter. “I can’t release you in good faith. You have an addiction, Potter, and you need help, and the only way you’re going to get it is if you stay here and listen to me.”Potter’s eyes widened slightly before he said in a tight voice, “Thought I was going to get a new Healer.”Draco applauded himself on not ripping his own hair out.“Do you like being difficult? What do you get out of it? What could you possibly gain from driving me mad?”“Well for one, I wouldn’t have to look at your stupid pointy face anymore.”“Great,” snapped Draco. “Lovely. I wasn’t aware that I was treating a five-year-old.”They glared at each other for a few more minutes, the atmosphere in the room uncomfortably tense.Finally, and with significant effort, Draco relaxed his shoulders and said in his best professional voice, “I think we’re set for now. Is there anything else I can do for you right now?”“Yeah. Leave me alone.” Draco decided that he would appeal to Granger and Weasley first and see if they could convince Potter to stay longer. If that failed, he’d go to Scarlett.He wrote a simple letter, professional and to the point, and gave it to one of the hospital’s owls.“To Ronald Weasley and Hermione Granger, please.”The owl fluttered its wings and took off through Draco’s window, leaving him to lean back in his chair and contemplate further.Ten minutes later, there was a sharp knock at the door. Draco had barely said ‘come in’ before it flung open and Granger and Weasley rushed in.“We got your letter,” Granger told him unnecessarily as she settled into a chair in front of Draco’s desk.Weasley joined her, his face pale and leg bouncing up and down where he sat.“Hey, Malfoy,” he said tensely.“Hello, Weasley, Granger,” Draco said, and folded his hands. He sighed. “As you read, Potter’s being difficult. He’s still under the impression that he’ll be leaving tomorrow, and I’m certain I don’t need to tell you how terrible that idea is.”Granger’s face was hard. “What can we do?”“Not much, I’m afraid,” Draco admitted. “We’re a hospital, not a prison. We can’t force Potter to stay here, and as for you…you can’t force a person into recovery. We can try, and try we will, but ultimately, it’s up to Potter to make the decision – to decide that he wants to recover.“And given Potter’s antagonism towards me,” Draco continued, glancing away, a frown on his face, “He’s even less likely to listen to me. So I’m hoping that you’ll try and convince him.”Granger face was screwed up and Draco was afraid that she’d start screaming or crying or both – and then it smoothed out into something very neutral (Draco was admittedly impressed). Weasley put his arm around her shoulders, and spoke instead.“He’s never listened to us before,” he said, his tone bitter. “We’ve been trying to help him for years, for all the good it’s done him. Why should this time be any different?”“He made the decision to come here,” Draco answered, looking Weasley square in the eye. “On some level, he knew he needed help and he acted on it. We have to take advantage of that and – “But then Leonel’s Patronus bounded in and said in his voice, “Come to Mr. Potter’s room immediately.”He had already stood up and pocketed his wand in the time it took for Granger and Weasley to exchanged panicked looks.“Come on.”

Chapter Text
“What – what are you doing here?”Harry couldn’t breathe. In, out. It wasn’t supposed to be this hard.“Hermione told me, Harry –““Stop,” Harry said weakly.He buried his head in his hands. In and out. His chest was growing increasingly tight and he felt ill and he really didn’t want –“Harry.”“Stop,” he yelled suddenly, and he heard – rather than saw – the window crack.He looked up into Ginny Weasley’s shocked brown eyes and took in her pale face, her fiery hair, and her trembling body. He realized that he was trembling, too.Harry curled his hands into his fists and looked away once more, not able to stomach how Ginny was staring at him, like she didn’t know him.He assessed the damage. Yes, the window was cracked. Wasn’t he supposed to lose the ability to do wandless magic now that Voldemort was dead?And then, just because he was so good at making Harry’s life even more annoying, Malfoy burst into the room, his robes billowing about dramatically. He was quickly followed by Hermione, Ron, and the American Healer.Harry let out a shaky laugh as he turned to face them. “Sure, come on in, you lot. Why not?”Hermione looked apologetic, Ron frustrated, Malfoy surprised, and the American Healer (what was his name?) was simply stunned."Never mind them. Look, Harry," Ginny said suddenly, her eyes flashing dangerously as she stepped forward. Harry blinked; he’d momentarily forgotten that she’d been there at all. "You've got a problem. I've known it for a long fucking time and I hate that I didn't try and help you more. But there's no use dwelling on the past, so the only thing to do now is fix it, and the only one who can do that is you. So you're not bloody leaving until it's sorted and you admit that you’re ill."Harry felt like he'd been slapped; Ginny appearing so suddenly was shock enough without her speaking so bluntly at him. Though to be truthful, he's had a lot of that in the past; it was just never about this.The tension in the air was palpable, and Harry desperately wished that everyone else would leave. Instead, they remained and glanced nervously between Ginny, still standing her ground, and Harry, who would've liked it if he simply ceased to exist.He wet his chapped lips and gulped tightly, trying to focus on Ginny's words instead of the mere fact that she'd said them. But what was he supposed to say? Yes, Ginny, I'm ill and need help so I'll stay.God, if only it was that simple.He'd never been one to ask for help. All his life, he'd had to deal with nearly everything on his own. He'd spent the first decade of life virtually alone, having to fend for himself against the Dursleys. And then, of course, there was the small bit of news about how he, a teenager at most, had to fight against a mass murderer and his equally murderous cult. He'd become so accustomed to having to survive on his own that he’d never grown out of it.He ground his teeth.But some part of him knew that he had come here – he had brought himself to St. Mungo’s. He knew that he was hanging on by a thread, and that his life had become dangerously pathetic (if he could even call it a life at this point).His gaze drifted from Ginny to Hermione and Ron. They’d never yelled at him, which was sort of shocking, thinking back on it. The only thing they ever did was look at him with some horrible mixture of pity and revulsion; they spoke gentle but stern words to him, as if he were a child that was prone to misbehaving.“Come on, Harry,” Ginny said, her voice softer now but still firm, “You’re smarter than this. You’re stronger than this.”Maybe it was Ginny, maybe it was her bullshit words, maybe it was her yelling, or maybe it was his pounding headache. And it could have been a dozen other things but that didn’t really matter right now because he felt himself fall apart.He felt horror and shock and disgust wash over him, like all his emotions had just been stuck behind some wall but the dam broke and he was finally absorbing it all – the numbness was gone and in its place was all these emotions, painfully visceral and overwhelming. And now, finally, he realized just how much he’d fucked up, just how abnormal he was.“Oh God,” he said, and threw up into his bucket.His empty stomach churning, he wiped his mouth and hung at the edge of his bed, unwilling to show his face to any of the five people in the room. His weak gasps of breath came ragged and irregular and his chest moved with them, his hands gripping the edge of the hospital bed as he stared into his vomit.“Harry?”He closed his eyes. In, out. It was easy, right?Harry then felt a gentle hand on his shoulder, and it reminded him so much of looking over Dumbledore’s dead body and Christ he wanted to be numb again. He didn’t have the energy or strength to revisit old memories; that was the point of all the potions and alcohol in the first place – to forget them.There was a dip in the bed as Ginny sat down, her hand still on Harry’s shoulder. He opened his eyes and turned to look at her.He couldn’t remember the last time he’d seen her – let alone this closely. She was beautiful as ever, though she already looked older and more mature. She wasn’t a teenage girl fighting for her life anymore; she was a woman, courageous and funny and kind and strong. Her brown eyes were sad as they studied Harry’s face. He suddenly felt conscious of how poorly he must have looked.“Harry,” she nearly whispered. She put a hand to his clammy cheek. “It’s all right.”And then he was weeping.He nearly dived into Ginny, who wrapped her arms around him without hesitation. He clung to Ginny’s warm body and sobbed like he’d never done before, the tears flowing freely for the first time in ages. And Ginny just held onto him like she’d never let him go.He felt so weak. He was weak and exhausted, and the taste of vomit was bitter in his mouth.Ginny rubbed small circles into Harry’s back as he cried and shuddered against her.“God, I’m sorry, I’m so sorry,” he tried to say, but he’s not sure she understood.Ginny shushed him and continued to stroke his back.Belatedly, he recognized the sound of a door opening and closing and realized that they were the only ones left in the room. Ginny noticed his head turn towards the door and confirmed his suspicions by saying, “They’ve left.”“Right.”He swallowed thickly and took off his glasses to wipe away the moisture from his face, feeling like an overlarge toddler. He let go of Ginny and sat up straight, finding it difficult to look her in the eyes.She smiled sadly and squeezed his thigh.“I’m –“ he began to apologize, but she shook her head.“You don’t need to say you’re sorry, Harry,” Ginny said firmly but not unkindly. “You needed to let it all out at one point.”“I reckon there’s more to let out,” he laughed weakly. He ran a hand through his greasy hair and said, “Fuck...how did this even happen?""The war's affected all of us, Harry.""You lot are living relatively normal lives," Harry said incredulously. "I mean, as far as I know, you've got careers and family and partners –“"We are your family," Ginny said, and sounded slightly hurt. "Even if, y'know, we didn't get married like Mum wanted us to.""I know," he bit his lip, remembering Mrs. Weasley's disappointment when he and Ginny broke up. He'd only just started getting bad then. "But it's not the same. Like, proper family.""Of course," Ginny said, a frown on her face. "But we're still here for you. You're stuck with us. For life."She hadn't cried yet, but her voice sounded unusually thick. She blinked and looked away."I'm sorry," Harry said after a few moments of silence. "I just - I don't know how it got this far. None of this feels real. I've almost...forgotten..."His words, though unsaid, hung in the air.Ginny gave a sharp little intake of breath."How long has it been?""I don't...not since the last time Hermione and Ron tried to get me to stop. I only made it a few days...""Not since March?" she asked, her voice thin.Had it really been that long? It felt like it was just yesterday.He shrugged. "I s'pose."Ginny took a deep breath. "You're getting help, Harry. You'll get through this, and we'll be here every step of the way.""What about the Harpies?""It's off-season.""And...Zabini?""He's still in New Zealand, but he'll join me as soon as I can," she said with a hint of defensiveness. She shifted, then added, "What, are you going to give me shit for it again?""I never –”She glared disbelievingly."I mean, a bit, but you can't say it wasn't surprising.""He's actually very decent," Ginny said, a delicate flush crossing her face, "And I happen to like him quite a bit. Just because you never got to know him-”"Literally when have I ever-""You were in the same bloody year. And in Slug Club.""Christ, don't remind me of that," Harry mumbled."Point is, he's a decent bloke and if you got to know him-”“I was a bit busy being a junkie, remember?” Harry joked darkly, and regretted the words as soon as they left his mouth.Ginny’s face fell.“Sorry – that was – er –”Ginny shook her head, her expression dark, and said, “Maybe we should ask Malfoy if joking about it is a good sign.”“What, you don’t call him ‘Draco,’ too?” Harry scowled, the thought of Malfoy just making his mood worse. “God, what a prat, still strutting about like he’s the best thing on earth, that ponce.”“Harry…”“What, I’m bent too, aren’t I?”“Still.”He sighed and lay down on the bed, rubbing his forehead. The headache was coming back and he was feeling a bit drained – maybe realizing that you’ve fucked your life up did that to you.Ginny seemed to understand, patting his thigh once more before standing and refilling his glass with a silent Aguamenti.“Thanks, Ginny.”“Of course, Harry,” she said, smiling softly down at him. “I’ll make sure to keep the masses at bay for a while, all right?”Harry almost laughed. “Thank you.”She nodded and walked to the door. Her hand on the knob, she stopped and turned to look back at him.“I love you, Harry. We all do,” Ginny said quietly, and exited the room. After lunch came, Harry decided to take a shower. He felt filthy, covered in sweat and his mouth still tasting of vomit. The mirror tutted at him, and he turned away from his own reflection with a scowl.He stripped slowly, his aching body resisting standing when he’d been lying in bed for so long. He set his glasses on the sink and turned on the water, getting in only when it was steaming.God, it actually felt good. The scalding water beat down on his skin, soothing his tense muscles and washing away the sweat and dirt that had accumulated in the past…several days? Week? He scrubbed his skin raw with the provided soap, putting it out of his mind. He was showering now – that was what counted.Harry then decided to tackle his hair, which felt greasy and matted underneath his fingers. He shampooed vigorously, and did it once more for good measure before conditioning. He rinsed off thoroughly, running water over his face and lathering it with soap. His fingers ran over his beard – he had to call it that at this point, it’d been a minute since he’d shaved. But he found that he rather liked it, and decided there was no reason to shave it off.He shut off the water and exited the shower, toweling off. He indulged in glancing at his reflection. He looked loads better. The shower couldn’t fix the dead look in his eyes or his shrunken appearance, but at least he didn’t feel so filthy.“There you go, boy, now get dressed,” said the mirror unnecessarily.Harry pulled on the hospital gown again with a scowl, feeling ridiculous. Madam Pomphrey never made him wear such foolish clothing, and he hadn’t made a trip to St. Mungo’s since his Auror days.He screwed his eyes shut and let out a shaky breath. He wanted a drink, or better yet, a potion.“Fuck.”It really wouldn’t be that hard to escape, Harry reasoned. Even without his wand, he could chance sneaking out. Yeah, he’d look mental with only the hospital gown and no shoes, but it was possible.“You’re mental anyway and it’d be easy,” Harry told himself, retrieving his glasses and shoving them on his face. “But you shouldn’t. You’d disappoint everyone. Again.”“I’m glad you know you’re mental already,” said the mirror. “I didn’t want to be the one to break it to you.”He exited the bathroom, slamming the door shut.An hour later there was a knock.It was Ginny again.“Hey, Harry,” she greeted softly, poking her head in. “How are you feeling?”“Like rubbish,” he answered truthfully.“You took a shower,” Ginny commented, a small smile on her face.“Yeah.” He sat himself up and asked her, “What is it?”“Hermione and Ron were wondering if they could see you.”He was both surprised and unsurprised to know that they wanted his permission, and from Ginny, no less. He was strangely touched but a bit hurt that they felt they couldn’t just talk to him.“Yeah, of course.”She nodded and withdrew herself from the crack in the door. A few seconds later, she opened it so his two closest friends could come inside, their faces strained and worried.“I’ll be outside, all right?” Ginny said, and left.Hermione looked at Harry with something like pain on her face. Ron’s arms were dangling by his sides, as if he were unsure of what to do with them.“I’m sorry,” Harry said when he couldn’t bear the silence anymore. “I’m so sorry.”Hermione flew over to the bed and hugged him tightly, her bushy hair in his face.“I’m going…I’m going to get better. I really will, this time,” he said, his throat tight as he hugged Hermione back with all his strength. “I swear.”Ron came over, his arms now crossed, and he frowned at the two of them. “Yeah, you will.”Harry nodded as Hermione released him and wiped her eyes. She stayed sat on the bed as Ron swept her hair away from her tear-streaked face.“I’ll try,” Harry amended. “I’ll stay here as long as Malfoy wants, as long as you want. I don’t – I can’t do this anymore.”Fresh tears leaked out of Hermione’s eyes, and Ron put a firm hand on his shoulder.“We’re here for you, mate,” he said.“I know,” Harry replied, his voice embarrassingly weak.“I’m so glad you’re staying,” Hermione said, her voice wobbly. She made no move to wipe the new tears away, instead staring at Harry with a deep sadness in her eyes. A sharp pain coursed through him; he’d done this to her. “This is the right thing to do.”“Yeah,” he managed to say despite the lump in his throat. Wanting to move away from the topic, he asked Hermione, “You told Ginny?”“Of course I did,” Hermione answered without shame. She finally wiped her tears away brusquely. “She has a right to know that you’re in hospital, and I figured she might be able to convince you.”“Well, you were right,” Harry grumbled.“You’re very important to her, Harry,” said Hermione, frowning now. “She’ll always care about your well-being.”“Yeah, I know,” he replied. “I just – I dunno, would’ve liked a warning before barging in here.”Hermione sighed. “I didn’t think she’d be able to come so early, with both her and Blaise so busy –”Harry’s face must have darkened, because Hermione asked tiredly, “What is it, Harry?”“I just still can’t believe you’re all so chummy with the Slytherins.”“It’s been years, Harry,” Hermione said. “It doesn’t even matter anymore. Blaise is perfectly fine, he’s clever and makes Ginny happy –”“Cos I didn’t, right?”Her eyes turned hard. “I didn’t say that.”Ron placed a comforting arm around Hermione’s shoulders and shot Harry a look.“No, you didn’t,” Harry shrunk back, not looking for a fight, “But you’re even mates with Malfoy now. Malfoy.”Ron shrugged. “He’s all right.”Harry goggled at him.“He’s still a prat,” Ron said defensively, “But he’s not that bad. And it’s not like we went out looking for him, he just came along with Ginny and Blaise one day and we happened to get on…”“What, just like that?”“It took a few drinks – I mean, a while, but yeah,” Ron said, stumbling over his words.“You can mention alcohol around me, Ron,” Harry mumbled. “It’s not like I forget about it when you’re talking about other things.”Ron looked away, while Hermione’s eyebrows furrowed.“How bad is it, Harry?” she asked softly.“Probably just as bad as you think it is.”Hermione took hold of Harry’s hand and looked him in the eye. “You’ll get through this. We’ll be here no matter what and help you however you want us to.”Harry nodded, unable to break eye contact even though he wanted to. He didn’t deserve friends like them. He wanted to say something to them – everything he’d said so far was inadequate – and he opened his mouth only to shut it again. Sorry I’m a fuck-up? Sorry I’ve gone and bollixed up my entire life? Sorry I’ve hardly been in your lives the past few years years? It was all inadequate.The three of them sat in silence for a several minutes; a knock at the door made them all jump.Ginny came in, her face apologetic.“Sorry, this a bad time?” she asked.“No, come in,” Harry offered, and she did.“Draco’s wanting to talk to you,” Ginny explained.Harry sighed. “Why not.”She gave him a sympathetic look before stepping out to presumably call him over. The prat came in a few seconds later, looking self-important as he unshrunk the notes that he kept in his pocket. He glanced up, his eyes widening a bit as they caught sight of Hermione and Ron.“Oh, I didn’t realize you two were still in here. I apologize.”“It’s fine, Draco,” Hermione said, standing up from Harry’s bed. “Should we leave?”“You certainly don’t have to, it’s up to…” he trailed off, his eyes shifting over to Harry.Harry shrugged. “They’ll know everything anyway.”Hermione bit her lip, relief on her face, and Ron grinned slightly.“All right,” Malfoy said. “Well, Potter, am I correct in saying that you’ve changed your mind since our last conversation?”Harry scowled and didn’t miss the inquisitive glances from his friends. “Yeah, I’m staying,” he said. “You won.”“I’m pleased you’ve decided to stay,” Malfoy said evenly. “I really believe you’ll benefit from giving a full recovery a chance. I’ll go ahead and contact the Mind-Healers and see if any of them will be able to take you on. Don’t worry – I’ll be discreet.”Harry laid back down, relaxing at Malfoy’s reassurance but still unhappy with the situation. The last thing he’d need right now was for Rita bloody Skeeter to catch wind of this whole thing.“Fine. Great.”“And how are you feeling now? Any changes in symptoms?”“Like rubbish, and not that I know of,” Harry said shortly.Malfoy scribbled something into his notes.“Have you been able to keep your food down?”Harry nodded. “Lunch is still fine.”“I’ll have someone bring you a nourishment potion, just in case,” Malfoy said, nodding to himself. He looked up, tucking his parchment underneath his left arm and withdrawing his wand. “I’m just going to check vitals.”He did so, and the four of them looked at the floating numbers in interest. Harry thought it was a rather silly method; he knew Muggles had equipment that’d keep the numbers up instead of floating away into nothingness.Malfoy nodded to himself again, not revealing any of the numbers’ meanings to the others, and began to scribble away.“So? How is it?”When Malfoy gave him a look, Harry continued. “What? I’ve got a right to know if I’m dying or not, don’t I?”“There’s no need to be so melodramatic, Potter, you’re not going to die,” Malfoy rolled his eyes. Harry wondered if he was this much of a dick to all of his patients. “Your vitals are still stable, and your body is nearly rid of all the foreign bodies. Of course, we’ll be administering a very weak Calming Potion to you tonight; it’ll ease your body and mind, and hopefully help you to sleep. You have been having trouble sleeping, haven’t you?”Harry nodded, flustered. He hadn’t mentioned that.“Insomnia is another common symptom of substance withdrawal,” Malfoy explained. “You have to tell me everything, Potter. Every little thing may count.”“I don’t sleep without help, anyway,” Harry mumbled defensively. “Seemed pretty normal.”Malfoy wrote something down again.“These will all be things to discuss with your Mind-Healer,” he said, without looking up.“Can’t wait.”

Chapter Text
Draco left Potter’s room, his mind now focused on finding a Mind Healer for Potter. They weren't in short supply after the war, what with the trauma and all, but Draco still wanted to provide Potter with the best treatment possible. Draco had gone to a Mind Healer himself, mostly at his mother's and Pansy's insistence.He and Pansy had drifted off after the war and trials. Draco had chosen to return to Hogwarts and work on becoming a Healer, while Pansy left for Spain to escape. They still wrote at the time, however, and became each other’s only confidants. With his father in Azkaban and his mother cooped up in the Manor, it was up to Draco to repair the image of the Malfoy name, if such a thing were even possible.Draco found calm in potions; it was methodical and demanded his undivided attention, forcing him to leave his thoughts for a while. He excelled and did well on his NEWTS, and worked his way up from the bottom of St. Mungo’s. It had been difficult at first – his name on its own was enough to make coworkers and superiors recoil. Yes, a former Death Eater now trying to save lives for a living. He saw the irony. Still, he worked without reservation, determined to show everyone that he'd changed - he was a Healer, and a damn good one too. Slowly, management began to realize that, and he began his slow climb to where he was now. He was incredibly busy and barely got time off, but that was the way he liked it. It took his mind off all the other less pleasant things. The bad thing about that, though, is that over the years, he became enveloped in his work and drifted away from his oldest friend.It wasn't with great difficulty that Draco chose to contact his former Mind Healer. Draco quite liked her, and he had to admit that she'd helped him a bit. Of course, he was by no means "fixed," but he'd still made a vast improvement. She was patient, compassionate, and never patronizing, but most importantly, she held patient confidentiality in the highest regard and didn't give a rat’s arse who you were. If you needed help, she was there to give it.When Draco had first walked into her office and given her his name, she barely blinked before asking him kindly if he’d like some tea or coffee. Of course, this may have been because she wasn’t British and hadn’t been in the country during the war, but something told Draco that even if she had been, she wouldn’t really care all that much.He felt confident that she would treat Potter like just another client and respect his privacy.Draco knelt onto his office floor and tossed some Floo powder into the small fireplace."Healer Julia Wolff's office."Draco stuck his head into the green flames, and he was met with Wolff's sensible heels. She stooped gracefully to his level somehow, and smiled at him."Draco. To what do I owe the pleasure?" she asked, a slight German accent punctuating her words."Purely business, I'm afraid. I was wondering if you'd be willing to take on a new client.""Of course. What sort of thing is he looking for?""Would you mind if I came through, actually? It'll need a bit of explaining.""Come in." She waved him in and stood up, disappearing from sight.A few seconds later, Draco was brushing himself off in Wolff's beige office. Julia Wolff sat at her desk, a calm, welcoming expression on her distinctly Germanic face. She smiled at Draco."Please sit down. Would you like some tea? Coffee, perhaps?"Draco was about to decline, and then he remembered how tired he was."Tea, if it isn't too much trouble,” he said as he sat down across from her.Wolff waved her wand and a kettle set about heating up some water."So," Wolff said, folding her hands in front of her, "Who is this client?""You must first understand that confidentiality is absolutely essential for this individual," Draco began, a slight frown on his face. He paused as the kettle poured tea into the teacup in front of him. He spooned a few cubes of sugar and stirred. "Thank you. As I was saying, he’s just very recently accepted help, so he’s still quite skittish. I believe his greatest concern is his privacy.""You know I take patient confidentiality seriously."Draco bowed his head. "Of course. It's just essential you understand just how important it is for this case in particular.”"Very well,” she frowned slightly. “Who is this client, and how did he come into your care?""He was found overdosed on a combination of potions and alcohol - he's been stabilized since, but he needs guidance. I know you have experience with addicts…and of course, war trauma."Wolff's caramel eyes softened. "Yes, unfortunately.""The patient is Harry Potter."It was a mark of how famous the man was when Wolff's eyes widened."I see," she said quietly after a moment.Draco reached into his pocket and withdrew Potters shrunken files, returning them to their original size and sliding them over to Wolff. She opened the files and looked over them with interest, the light crow’s feet around her eyes crinkling."Yes, of course I can take him," she said after she had finished, and closed the files and returned them to Draco. "Pass along my contact details to him and we will arrange an appointment whenever you deem appropriate. I’d also like a copy of your institution’s files, whenever it is convenient."Draco nodded and finished the rest of his tea. "Thank you, Healer Wolff.""It is no problem," she said and cocked her head. "And how are you, Draco? Are you doing well?""Yes, thank you.""Are you remembering work-life balance?""Yes," Draco said, trying not to roll his eyes.She didn't look convinced but waved him away. "I'll speak with you soon, Draco. If you’d ever like to make an appointment –"“Yes, of course,” he cut over her quickly, suddenly wanting to leave Wolff’s office. “Thank you, Healer Wolff.”Wolff frowned a bit before bidding him goodbye. Leonel was in Draco’s office when he stepped through.“Oh!” Leonel exclaimed, stepping closer to Draco as the latter brushed himself off. “Sorry. I was just looking for you.”“Is something the matter?” Draco asked, still a bit shaken from seeing Wolff.It’d been over a year since he’d had an appointment with Wolff but talking to her still left Draco rattled. He’d been in a disastrous state at the start of his therapy, and that was what came to mind whenever he set foot in Wolff’s office, despite first seeing her two and a half years ago.“No, I just had a question about…” Leonel trailed off at the look on Draco’s face. “Are you ok?”“Hmm?”“You don’t look so good.” His dark eyes were compassionate, his tone suddenly softer, and Draco was once again reminded why Leonel made such a good Healer. “You can still talk to me, Draco.”Hearing Leonel say his name in such a gentle tone sent a chill up Draco’s spine. He felt his face grow hot as he leaned against his desk. Memories of them fucking on that very same desk flashed unhelpfully through Draco’s mind.“I’m fine,” Draco said, his throat tight. “You just caught me at a bad time.”Something about Leonel’s eyes urged him to continue.“I just got back from talking to Julia.”Leonel understood immediately; cautiously, he asked, “For an appointment?”“No,” Draco said defensively, though he had no reason to feel embarrassed. He was seeing Wolff when he and Leonel were dating, anyway. “I asked if she would agree to see Potter.”“Oh,” Leonel said, visibly relaxing. “Then what’s the matter?”“Being in her office still reminds me of when I was…seeing her,” Draco admitted. He didn't think he’s ever told someone that before. “It’s ridiculous, but –““It’s not, Draco,” Leonel interrupted. “It makes total sense that being there brings back painful memories.”Draco was grateful for Leo's kind words but only scoffed in response. “I don’t need you to counsel me, Leo. I’ve already had enough of that.”Leonel smiled a bit. “Yeah, of course. My bad.”They stood in comfortable silence for a moment. It was times like these when Draco wondered why they broke up in the first place, but it only took a few minutes to remember the reasons. They were infinitely better as friends and colleagues; their overwhelming passion burned them out so quickly that they grew bored of each other just as fast.“Anyway, sorry, what was it that you wanted to ask me?” Draco asked, breaking himself out of his reverie.“Nothing. Don’t worry about it,” Leonel said, a slight smile on his face. “See you later, Healer.”And with that, Leonel left Draco’s office, leaving him with only his thoughts.An hour later found Draco sorting through all of his notes on Potter, compiling them into one condensed document for Healer Wolff. He had a hospital owl fly it over to her in a neat package stamped “CONFIDENTIAL.”Draco then fished through the bottom drawer of his desk for one of Healer Wolff’s business cards – simple little things with a framed Wolff smiling solemnly on them. He held it in his hands, frowning down at the black-and-white Wolff.Should he give it to Potter now? Or should he wait until tomorrow? Draco checked his watch. It was already six. Would it be better to leave Potter to rest for the night? He knew he didn’t exactly aid Potter in relaxing – quite the opposite, really. But on the other hand, he wanted to give Potter Wolff’s contact details as soon as possible on the chance that Potter would change his mind about treatment again.Realistically, Draco didn’t have to see Potter until tomorrow. He had made his rounds earlier in the day and checked on all of his other patients then. But perhaps he should check on Potter again. He did say he wanted Potter to have another nourishment potion.Draco squirmed at the thought that he was focusing so much energy on one patient; he was a Healer, for Salazar’s sake. A patient is a patient, and patients should be treated equally.Harry Potter. Even after eight years, it all comes back to him. Draco didn’t even know why he spent so much time dwelling on the prat. It’s not like he was even thankful, or nice…which is not the point, Draco reminded himself. You’re a Healer. Thanks or no thanks, you help people. That’s what you do.Draco sighed. Potter always did have a penchant for driving him mad.He put the business card on his desk and set about Flooing home. He’d do it tomorrow. He sent a Patronus to Betty asking her to administer the nourishment potion to Potter and left.Draco returned to St. Mungo’s the next morning refreshed. After stopping at his office, he made his way to the employee lounge and found Betty and Ira there. The two of them were sat on the couch, apparently engrossed in conversation.“Good morning,” Draco greeted, making his presence known.“Good morning, Draco,” said Ira, smiling up at him. “We were just talking about you and Leonel.”“I – what?” Draco stammered, completely caught off guard. “Why?”Betty flushed furiously, glaring daggers at Ira and deftly ignoring Draco.“Oh, come on,” Ira rolled their eyes. “We all know that you two dating was the most exciting thing to happen to St. Mungo’s staff. Most likely in the entire history of this fine establishment.”“That’s ridiculous. And why are you even talking about it now? We’ve been split for ages.” Draco crossed his arms, feeling supremely uncomfortable. For a horrible moment, he thought that Ira and Betty had somehow found out about what happened yesterday – that confusing moment.“I know, Draco,” Ira replied. “No need to kick up a fuss. We were just recounting all the times either one of us had walked in on you two –““Shut up,” Draco hissed, anger and embarrassment boiling up within him. “You know I’m not above using hexes on you.”“I’m sorry, Healer Malfoy,” Betty said quietly, still not meeting his eyes.“You adore us, Draco,” Ira added.“’Adore’ might be too strong a word, White,” Draco seethed. He turned to Betty, who seemed even smaller than usual. “Betty, I just wanted to ask if you gave Potter that nourishment potion.”“I did, Healer,” she replied quickly. “He was doing fine when I saw him.”“Good,” said Draco stiffly. “And what about Jones?”“She remained stable throughout the night,” Betty answered.“Fantastic. And what are you still doing here? It’s six-thirty already.”“I know,” Betty nodded. “I was just getting my things when Healer White and I started talking…”She flushed a bright pink, the color obvious against her pale skin.“Go home, Betty. You’ve done well,” Draco sighed. “And Ira, piss off.”By eleven, Draco had checked up on his patients, had a few frank talks, been told off twice, and released one person. There was only one more thing to check off on his morning agenda: talk to Potter.He steeled himself outside of Potter’s door. He was still unsure of how to act around him; Potter was like a stranger to him now. He’d always sort of been one, but he was much easier to read when he was a teenager. Now that he was coming off potions and alcohol, the withdrawals were making him irritable, unstable, and moody. Most cases that came through Draco’s department were fairly straightforward, but addiction was a completely different matter.Even worse, the patient in question was the same person Draco had fancied in his formative years.Simply admitting it in his head was difficult. Draco'd been trying to repress most of his memories of Hogwarts, several of them having to do with Potter and his pathetic obsession with him, just because it was easier that way. And he was doing a fine job of it too, until just a few days ago.Draco knocked on the door with a bit too much force.A moment later, Ginevra poked her head out the door.“Yes?”“Is now a good time?”She stuck her head back in, and Draco heard her talk briefly with Potter. Ginevra reemerged and opened the door wide, allowing Draco access and her to leave.“Bye, Harry.”Draco walked inside, forcing his face to be as impassive as possible. Potter stared at Draco with the same defiant look he had given him when Draco had first walked into his hospital room, daring him to say something.“Potter, how are you doing?” Draco asked, his voice perfectly professional, though he could tell his forehead was probably pinched.He busied himself by pulling out Potter’s file and reviewing it.“Not that great, Malfoy,” Potter said evenly.Draco looked up. “Has there been a change in your symptoms?”Potter shook his head.“Good,” Draco murmured. “I’d like to check your vitals.”“All right.”Draco proceeded to do so and wrote down his findings, pleased to see that Potter was steadily improving.“How’s it looking, Healer?” Potter asked, his voice dripping with sarcasm.“Better,” Draco said, meeting Potter’s angry eyes. “I’m satisfied with how you’re progressing.”“Great.”Draco paused, continuing to stare neutrally at Potter. He felt disgusting for even thinking it, but Potter was somehow still attractive at his worst. The eyes were the same – bright green and intense. His hair was longer, and now that it was washed, Draco could see that it was starting to curl towards the ends. And the facial hair…suffice to say, it suited him.He cursed inwardly to himself. So this is what dredging up old memories did; it made Draco think the unspeakable. Potter was a patient.“Anyway,” Draco said abruptly, “I wanted to talk to you about finding you a Mind-Healer. I would like to recommend Julia Wolff, an accomplished Mind Healer who's well-versed with the War and how it’s affected people. I think that you may be able to benefit from her practice. I’ve brought her card with me…here.”Draco handed it to Potter, who took it hesitantly. He looked at the card, his expression unreadable, before glancing back up at Draco.“You really think she can help me?” Potter asked, the harsh tone of voice gone.“Yes,” Draco answered. “Like I said, she has lots of experience and is one of the best in the field. I’ve already spoken to her and she’d be happy to have you as a patient. And of course, patient confidentiality is her highest priority, so you don’t need to worry about that.”“But can she help me?”Potter’s eyes were almost pleading. His fist was clenched around the card, which was now surely crumpled. He was sitting up, leaning forward and towards Draco. He thought about Potter’s breakdown yesterday. Draco felt a twinge of pain in his chest.“She’s compassionate, intelligent, and genuinely wants the best for her patients,” Draco said. “But you have to put in effort too. You can’t go in and expect to be cured instantly. You’ve got to give as good as you get, Potter, you must understand.”Potter slumped against the bed and whispered so lowly that Draco had to work to understand him.        “I don’t know what I’ll do if I fuck up again.”Draco’s chest was cold and tight; what was he supposed to say? He wasn’t a Mind-Healer. He wasn’t even a kind person. He didn’t know how to comfort people at this emotional level. Feeling panicked, he said the first thing that came to mind.“She helped me,” he said.Potter looked up, surprise in his face.“I saw her…after the War. And she helped me,” Draco rambled. “I’m functioning now. Perhaps I’m still not a ‘normal’ person, but I can do normal things. As you can obviously tell. But I think…if you go to every appointment and listen to her and take her advice, she can really help you.”Potter was staring at him again, hard, but it wasn’t angry like the last time. No, now they were wide, full of wonder perhaps. Draco shifted nervously, dropping his gaze to his files and staring blankly at them. What on earth possessed him to say all that? He really hoped he wasn’t crossing any Healer/patient barriers by telling that to Potter, but he didn’t think he did. Not any real ones, anyway. He’d check the employee handbook later.Gathering his waning courage, Draco met Potter’s gaze again.“I shouldn’t have said that to you,” he said quickly. “I apologize for my inappropriate conduct. If there’s anything else I can do for you…?”Potter shook his head.“Brilliant,” Draco said, relieved. “I’ll be taking my leave, then.”And he did. As soon as he had shut the door, he was ambushed by Granger and Weasley.Draco gave an audible gasp and stepped back, his free hand coming to his chest. Weasley badly stifled a laugh.“Oh, sorry, Draco! We didn’t mean to startle you,” Granger said apologetically. “We were just waiting to talk to Harry.”“Yes, of course,” Draco replied, his heart still pounding. There was much too much happening right now. “He’s all yours. Good day.”He was already walking away when Granger called out, “Wait!”Draco turned at her voice.She caught up to him a few paces, Weasley behind her.“Since Ginny is back in town, we were thinking of going out tonight,” Granger explained. “You know, to let off some steam. Would you like to join us?”“Oh.” Draco blinked. “Without Blaise?”“He's back in London too. Just came in this morning, and just for a day or two,” Granger said. “They’re at Molly’s and Arthur’s.”Draco raised his eyebrows at Weasley, who gave a slight shrug.“Come on,” Weasley then said. “You deserve a break as much as anyone. You’re wound up tighter than…I dunno. You might be wound tighter than anyone I know. And I’m engaged to this one.”He nudged Granger with his shoulder, and the former gasped in offense.“Fine, yes, as long as Blaise comes.”“Good,” beamed Granger. “I’ll let Ginny know. We’re planning on eight at the Dotted Lamb.”“I’ll see you then.”Draco Apparated outside of the Dotted Lamb at 7:58 and was wondering if he should head inside and get a table for all of them when Blaise and Ginevra appeared. They caught sight of each other quickly and congregated in a small circle.“Blaise. It’s good to see you,” Draco said. “How’s New Zealand?”“Oh, business as usual,” Blaise said in that silken voice of his. “It's a nice place, but there’s far too much greenery, if you ask me.”  "How much longer have you got over there?""Can't know for certain, yet, but I'd say at least half a year more.""Well, it was good of you to come. Especially with the distance...""Yes, well, the things we do for love, eh?" Blaise said, glancing down at his girlfriend.Ginevra smiled at them knowingly.

Chapter Text
Harry woke up with a pounding ache in his head. He'd hardly been awake for two moments when an overwhelming urge to throw up overcame him, and he did so promptly.As he straightened up from the side of the bed, his eyes caught on the shiny black card that Malfoy had given him yesterday. It was sitting on the bedside table innocently enough, but as soon as Harry’s tired brain processed what it was, he felt nauseated all over again. Annoyed, Harry snatched the business card and glared down at it.“I don’t need a therapist,” he told it angrily.The picture of Mind-Healer Wolff smiled gently at him.“I’ve gotten this far without one, haven’t I?”Wolff continued to smile.“Just because Malfoy went doesn’t mean I need to. I’m just stronger than he is.”Perhaps it was his imagination, but Wolff responded by asking, “Or is he stronger for asking for help?”Harry scoffed. “What did he need you for, anyway? He just worked for Voldemort until it wasn’t convenient anymore. Then he just ran away cos he's a coward," Harry told the card feverishly. "I was actually fighting against Voldemort, I died for it – what he went through was nothing compared to me.”His heart was beating rapidly and his head was still throbbing with pain; Harry closed his eyes and leaned against the metal headboard.“God, I haven’t had this bad of a headache since He was still around,” he mumbled.He waited for Wolff to respond, and when she didn’t, he continued.“I can’t believe Malfoy went to a Mind-Healer. And recommended the one he went to for me. Maybe I’m just dreaming, and that’s why you’re talking.”He opened his eyes and glanced down at Wolff’s card. She said nothing.Harry tossed it on the floor.At seven, Betty came to give Harry his breakfast and check on his vitals.“Good morning, Mr. Potter,” she greeted.“Morning,” he said kindly enough.Harry liked Betty. She was quiet and didn’t really seem to care who he was.She placed a bowl of porridge, an orange, and a glass of pumpkin juice on the tray that was now floating above Harry’s lap.“I’ll just check your vitals now, Mr. Potter.”“Alright,” Harry responded.He poked at his warm porridge with the plastic spoon and knew he wouldn’t be eating any of it. Even if he wanted to, he didn’t think his stomach could manage it.Instead, he watched Betty wave her wand and mumble something under her breath. The warmth that blossomed unnaturally in his chest was familiar by now, as were the numbers that appeared in the air above him. Her eyebrows furrowed as she noted them down on the files at the foot of the bed.“How are you feeling?” she asked, her voice a bit tenser than usual.“The usual, I have a headache, nausea…”“Your temperature indicates you have a fever,” she frowned as she scanned her files. She began speaking at a faster pace, her volume dropping with every word. “You were relatively normal yesterday, and this is very sudden…I don’t think Healer Malfoy will be coming in until noon…I’ll have to let Leo know…”Lifting her wand, Betty concentrated and exclaimed, “Expecto Patronum!”A silver squirrel burst out of her wand in wisps.“Please tell Leonel Estrada that I need his help in Mr. Potter’s room.”Her Patronus scurried off, and Harry was hit by a pang of nostalgia as he watched it. It’d been years since he’d seen his stag.“I’m sorry,” Betty apologized, turning to him, her eyes wide. She must've been able to read the dismay on his face. “It’s just that I’m a trainee and I need to let one of my superiors know…”“Yeah, of course.”There was an uncomfortable silence in the air as they waited for the other Healer to arrive. Should he try to make conversation? He didn’t know anything about Betty, aside that her name was Betty and she was a Healer-in-Training.He blurted out the first thing that came to mind.“What’s it like working with Malfoy?”Betty blinked in surprise. “I’m sorry?”“What’s he like? Is he nice to you?”“I – yes, he’s always been kind to me,” Betty answered, a slight frown on her face. “He’s a great leader and very patient with everyone…he works a lot, though. Why do you ask?”Harry paused, listening to her words with fascination. “I went to Hogwarts with him. He was, er, a bit of a prat.”Huge understatement, Harry thought to himself.“I know. I was four years behind you two. Both of you were common gossip even among us underclassmen.”“Oh.” It was Harry’s turn to be surprised. “I didn’t know. What house were you?”“Ravenclaw. My family wasn’t too pleased. I’m a Burke, you see,” she explained.Harry raised his eyebrows. “Any relation to the Burke of Borgin and Burkes?”“He was my great-uncle.”Harry studied her long, dark hair, her pale skin, and her cheekbones. He could see it now.“And of course, you were in Gryffindor,” Betty went on, apparently oblivious to or ignoring his visual inspection of her. “By the time I got to Hogwarts, you were in fifth year and Umbridge was in charge. I was so disappointed – I’d heard all these wonderful things about Headmaster Dumbledore and just to have him disappear…and then…”She colored slightly, and Harry figured she’d heard the rumors that he had been there when Dumbledore died.There was a sudden, crisp knock at the door, and the American Healer entered the room.“Good morning, Mr. Potter. Betty, what’s happened?”“I was just checking Mr. Potter’s vitals when I saw that he has a fever. One moment…”She cast the spell again and the numbers and lines came into existence once more. The American Healer – his badge simply said Healer Estrada – scanned them all before his eyes landed on one number in particular.“39.6°? That’s…what, about 103° in Fahrenheit? Christ,” muttered Estrada. “Betty, could you go get me a Fever-Reducing Potion?”“Yes, Healer,” she said, already starting to leave as she said it.“Could you tell me what symptoms you’re experiencing right now?” Estrada asked, quill at the ready.“I’ve got a headache, I’m nauseous, I still can’t sleep well…”Harry tried to think of other symptoms he might be experiencing, but those were the only three he could come up with. Well, aside from having a conversation with a business card, but Estrada didn't need to know that.“Your heart rate is a bit high as well,” Estrada said, scribbling as he spoke. “Have you been anxious?”“I’m always anxious, Healer.”Estrada frowned. “Have you been perspiring more than usual?”“I reckon I have been…”“But you haven’t had any seizures…we would have caught them if you did. Have you been having nightmares?”“No more than usual,” Harry said plainly.“I see. We’ll continue checking on you, Mr. Potter,” Estrada said. “I’d like to keep an eye on you and make sure that you stay out of danger. Once the Healer-In-Charge comes in, we’ll do that final step of cleansing, and you should be out of the woods. Does that sound good to you?”“Er, sure.”“Great. Trainee Burke should be back in a second with that potion,” Estrada smiled. “And be sure to eat your breakfast, Mr. Potter. Your body needs the nutrients and energy.”Harry had no intention of doing so but nodded anyway. Estrada left the room with one last reassuring smile.Like Estrada had predicted, Betty entered the room a moment later with a light knock and a pale blue potion.“Oh.” Betty looked around in surprise. “Has Healer Estrada gone already?”“He left right before you came in,” answered Harry.“Alright,” she said and approached him. “This is the Fever-Reducing Potion, and it’s rather self-explanatory.”“I reckoned.”Betty smiled, and amazingly enough, Harry did too.Sure enough, at half past noon, Malfoy and Estrada came into Harry’s room.“Good afternoon, Potter,” said Malfoy as Estrada set down potions and other miscellaneous items. “I understand you had a bit of a fever this morning.”“Yeah, I did.”“I’ll check up on your vitals and we’ll see if it’s improved,” Malfoy informed him as he drew his wand.Once again, the warm feeling in his chest was back and all sorts of stats appeared in the air.“Brilliant,” said Malfoy. “You’re at 37.2°C, which is just bordering on healthy. I’m glad that the potion’s worked.”When Harry offered nothing but a wry smile, Malfoy continued.“You’re still in the thick of it now in terms of withdrawal, but fortunately, with wizarding technologies we can alleviate many of the symptoms. Like your fever, for instance.”“How long’s it supposed to last again?” Harry asked, positive he'd asked the question before but couldn't remember the answer for the life of him.“Both types typically last about a week or so. You’re on…” Malfoy paused to check his notes, “day four.”“Great,” Harry said, crestfallen. He was sure he’d been in here longer than just four days.“There is much more Muggle data on withdrawal and addiction, so it may be shorter than a week,” Malfoy said, though he didn’t sound entirely confident. “The most important thing is that your symptoms are managed. I’ve said before that they may be life-threatening, and that’s certainly true, especially considering how long you’ve been dependent on these drugs. But with magic, they’re contained and reduced in ways that Muggle science cannot achieve. In fact, –”“So forget all those poor Muggle buggers as long as I won’t die, right?”Malfoy bristled. “No, Potter. It’s just – the way it is, unfortunately.”Harry didn’t say anything; he crossed his arms and looked at the clock, away from Malfoy’s stupid face.Estrada cleared his throat and said, “Healer Malfoy, I am ready to begin as soon as you are.”Harry looked at him from the corner of his eye; he reckoned Estrada was an upstanding Healer, what with the way he didn’t look bothered at all and was carrying on like Harry was the usual type of patient they got in the ward, and that Malfoy always interacted with patients like this.“Wonderful,” said Malfoy, clasping his hands together like the insufferable prat he was. “Potter, this is the final step of the cleansing procedure and will be much gentler than the past two were. All we must do is administer two potions and perform a spell to make them interact like we’d like them to.”“Right.”He caught Malfoy huff out a breath as he walked towards Estrada. Malfoy was right; this last one didn’t hurt nearly as much as the second one had.The cleansing was over and done with in fifteen minutes, and the two Healers took their leave shortly after they’d finished. Once the door was shut, Harry went to pick up the business card Malfoy had given him the day before. Luckily, Malfoy hadn’t seen it on the ground, or if he had, he didn’t comment on it.He got back to his bed and stared at Wolff’s smiling face.Four days. It’s the longest he’d ever been in hospital at a time.He knew he had to get better. Otherwise this would all be for nothing – being trapped in this room, having his friends see him like this, talking to bloody Malfoy about his own fucked-up state of being. He knew, somewhere deep within, that if he didn’t see Wolff and “fix” the underlying issue, he’d go right back to supporting his addiction and wasting away. That’s what had always happened, after all.Could Wolff really help him stay clean? It seemed unthinkable at this point. This was who he was now. He was his addiction. Or at least if felt like he was.But Harry didn’t think he could bear to see the disappointment and pain again in Hermione’s face, in Ron…in Ginny. He’d let them down so many times by saying he’d stop, saying that this was the last time, swearing that he was clean and sober and good and inevitably falling right back into his addiction.Malfoy said Wolff would help, didn’t he? He apparently knew from first-hand experience that she was a good Mind Healer. But that was Malfoy. He and I are completely different, he thought stubbornly. But in terms of Malfoy not even needing help…he didn’t feel as strongly about that as he had this morning. There’s all sorts of trauma, isn’t there?God, even just thinking the word ‘trauma’ made Harry cringe.He sighed deeply, finally ready to talk to Malfoy about his decision.And then he realized there was no way to contact him. Or maybe there was? It would make no sense if there wasn’t. Patients need assistance and a way to get it, don’t they? He felt it was rather rudimentary.Harry looked around him for any sort of communication device, thinking about how much easier this would all be if he just had his wand. Finally, he found a small, glowing button on one end of the headboard. Somehow, Harry felt that this was the one, and he pressed it.“Assistance will be here shortly,” said a pleasant, tinned voice.“Someone could have told me that you existed,” Harry replied.He sat back and waited for someone to arrive.It was Malfoy. He rushed in after just one knock, his expression serious.“Is something wrong, Potter?” he asked urgently, fixing his grey eyes on Harry.He almost seemed to be out of breath.“Er, no,” Harry frowned. “I just wanted to talk to you.”Malfoy visibly relaxed, brushing away strands of hair that had come loose. Harry took this time to study Malfoy, his hands, his hair, his sharp face –“Very well,” Malfoy said, drawing closer. He seemed surprised, perhaps even curious. “What did you want to discuss with me?”“I’ve thought about it.” Harry removed his gaze from Malfoy and instead stared down at the card that sat on the bed beside him. “I think – I’ll go.”He glanced up, chewing his bottom lip in nervousness. Malfoy had a peculiar expression on his face, and when he met Harry’s eyes, there was a flicker of a smile. It changed his face completely for a split second.“Excellent,” Malfoy said in a voice nicer than Harry had ever heard it. “I'll reach out to Dr. Wolff today and schedule an appointment for you. When would you like it to be?”Harry hadn’t thought that far ahead.“Er…”Malfoy seemed to catch on and offered, “I’ll find out which slots she has available and let you decide based on that. Is that alright?”Harry could only nod, disarmed by this side of Malfoy. Even more shocking was the slight smile Malfoy gave him – a real one this time.“I'm glad you’ve decided to accept help, Potter,” he explained, voice almost gentle. Harry was borderline disturbed by it and said nothing, simply choosing to watch as Malfoy became less of a robot and more of an actual person. “I sincerely think that it will help you.”“You’re not just saying that?” Harry asked, finally finding his voice.“No,” Malfoy responded. “I think Dr. Wolff is an outstanding individual and an even better Mind Healer. I’m confident in her abilities and recommend her to many of my patients for good reason.”Harry worked his lip, trying to decide whether or not he should prod further.“You said…she helped you?”Malfoy’s forehead pinched, and Harry was worried that he would clam up again.“She did,” Malfoy answered slowly. “I saw her for quite a bit of time and I’ve come out for the better. I hope my…personal testimony will harden your resolve, if anything.”“It has,” Harry said truthfully, seeming to surprise both Malfoy and himself by doing so. He hurried to add something to distract from it. “I mean – if she can help a prat like you become less annoying, then she must be alright.”Malfoy raised his eyebrows, likely unconvinced by Harry’s weak attempt at an insult. Harry's face burned.“Very well,” he said, his voice finally back to normal and easing Harry’s tension. “If there’s nothing else, I’ll go ahead and contact Dr. Wolff.”“Yeah…that’s it.”Malfoy gave a small nod and turned to leave. His hand was on the doorknob when Harry spoke again.“Wait, er, Malfoy.”Malfoy turned round to look at him.“Thanks,” was all Harry could muster.It seemed to be enough. Malfoy nodded again, a small smile playing at his lips. It wasn’t until the next morning that Malfoy came back with openings for an appointment with Dr. Wolff.“Morning, Potter,” Malfoy greeted as he came in.“Morning,” Harry said, anxiety tying his chest up in knots.He didn't even know what he was anxious about. Dr. Wolff? Therapy? Malfoy?“I’ve got some slots for you,” Malfoy said as he withdrew a slip of paper from his clipboard. “Unfortunately, she didn't have any openings until next week. She can always make exceptions for emergencies, however, if necessary.”“No, that’s fine.”He handed Harry the paper; he was careful not to touch Malfoy’s hands as he took it from him.Looking down at the sheet, he was surprised to see a list of dates in a rushed, loopy handwriting instead of a calendar or schedule like he had expected. It must have been Malfoy's writing; this thought alone made Harry's heart stutter. Remembering himself, he examined the dates and saw that she was indeed booked until next week. The soonest available appointment was on Monday at 10 am.“The first one is fine,” he said, raising his head and handing it back to Malfoy. “10 on Monday.”Malfoy stuck the paper back on his clipboard and made a little note on it.“Excellent. I’ll let her know,” Malfoy said. He checked his watch. “I trust Trainee Healer Burke checked your vitals at seven?”“Yeah, she did.”Malfoy glanced over the files at the end of the bed and nodded, apparently pleased.“Good, you’re improving splendidly; your vitals are stabilizing. No sign of a fever. We’ll still be monitoring you, of course. I’d like you to stay here until at least this coming Monday. By then, it’ll have been a week since you’ve arrived.”Harry nodded. He was surprisingly relieved that he could stay at St Mungo’s longer. He didn’t think he could do it on his own yet.And maybe he was happy to know he’d still be in Malfoy’s presence.Harry was slowly becoming infatuated with Malfoy.Over the next few days, that much had become clear to him.He was so different from the boy Harry knew at Hogwarts. He was no longer callous and rude, calling out insults or choreographing out ways he could hurt Harry. This Malfoy was straight-forward, dedicated, and intelligent. He clearly cared for his patients and coworkers. He could still be a bit of a git, sure, but he was generally patient and understanding - even with Harry, and he knew that he had to have been a nightmare the first few days he'd been in St Mungo's. Harry thought that he had a good enough reason to be, but he was still embarrassed by his behavior. Despite this, Malfoy didn't relinquish his duties, and Harry was grateful for it. Treating Harry seemed to be Malfoy's priority, putting their old rivalry to rest.And he was incredibly fit.Not that Harry was shallow. But also, who could blame him for lusting after his Healer when he looked like that?Malfoy had aged quite well - scratch that, incredibly well. His eyes seemed warmer somehow, reminding Harry of Sirius now more than anything. They used to be so hard and cold, but now they seemed softer. More open. Was that even possible? It all could’ve just been in Harry’s head - in fact, it probably was.There was a sudden knock at the door, making Harry jump a little.“Hullo, Harry.”It was Ginny. Harry smiled at her.“Hey, Gin.”But then someone came up behind her, a someone he’d rather not have in his hospital room.“Potter,” Blaise Zabini greeted, tipping his head.Harry’s eyes flashed to Ginny immediately, silently asking her why in the hell she’d brought him here.“I’ve brought Blaise,” she said unnecessarily. She raked a hand through her bright hair as she peered up at Zabini. She furrowed her brows and turned her gaze back to Harry. “I was hoping you wouldn’t mind, but I can kick him out if you’d like.”He wanted to yell at her, tell her to get him out immediately, but they both knew that Harry had a hard time saying no to Ginny.“No,” he sighed. “It’s fine.”Ginny gave him an appreciative smile and came close, sitting down in one of the chairs. Zabini sat down next to her, the expression on his face indiscernible.“Blaise is going back to New Zealand tonight and I wanted you two to properly meet,” Ginny explained, her voice firm. “You’re both very important to me and I can’t have the two of you at each other’s throats forever.”“I’d like to extend my condolences and well wishes,” Zabini said, his voice low and smooth. His dark eyes were fixed on Harry. “My thoughts are with you during this difficult time.”Harry fidgeted. ‘Difficult time’ seemed a bit of a strange thing to call an addiction, but he wasn’t about to point that out.“Er, thank you,” he said as cordially as he could manage. “I appreciate it.”“Merlin, this isn’t going to work.” Ginny sighed as if Harry's uncharacteristic thanks was the breaking point. She turned to Zabini. “Sorry, I think you’ll have to leave.”Zabini nodded, kissed her cheek, and left the room.Ginny sighed again.“I didn’t know why I thought that was going to work.”Harry nearly laughed from the absurdity of it all, but instead replied, “I'll admit it wasn't one of your best ideas.”“I mean it though,” Ginny frowned. “That I want you to get along. Blaise and I – we’ve talked about marriage. And if it does happen, I don’t want every Sunday brunch to be as uncomfortable as that was.”“Maybe we should reschedule the official meeting for another time,” Harry suggested. “Like maybe when I’m not in hospital. Does he even know what I’m in here for?”Ginny made a face that very plainly meant she was sorry. Harry glowered at her.“I tell him everything, Harry!” she said defensively. “This isn’t an exception.”“I reckon it’s fine,” Harry sighed. “I should have expected it. As long as he doesn’t tell anyone else.”“Of course he wouldn’t.”“If you say so.”They sat in silence for a moment, and then,“You don’t mind me barging in here every day, do you? I can stop.”“No, it’s nice,” Harry said truthfully. “There’s nothing to do here. At least in Muggle hospitals they have tellys.”Not that he’d ever been in one. He’d caught snippets of hospital scenes on Dudley’s television sets when he was a child.“Oh, Dad has one of those somewhere. It’s supposed to do something, right? Not just sit there?”“Yeah, it plays stories. Like wizard photographs but with sound.”Ginny appeared to make sense of this concept for a moment before giving up.“Never mind. My point was that it’s really boring in here and I appreciate the company.”Ginny grinned.“Good. I would have kept coming anyway.”“I know.”Now it was Harry’s turn to ask a question – something that was still eating away at Harry’s mind.“So you’re really mates with Malfoy?”Ginny gave a strange combination of a grimace and a smile.“I don’t know about mates. We’ve definitely gone out together, Malfoy, Blaise, and me. Sometimes their friends join us, and sometimes it’s Ron and Hermione. He’s really not that bad. He can be funny, you know, and he’s dead serious about his job. And you know I hated the bastard.”“We all did,” Harry said quietly. “I can tell he’s changed. It’s just – strange.”“It’ll take a bit to get used to,” Ginny agreed.He wondered if he should tell her that he’d slowly been getting obsessed with Malfoy all over again. He honestly didn’t know how she would react.“Gin…”“Yeah?”“Is…er…he’s quite fit, isn’t he?”As soon as the words had left his mouth, Harry knew he had made a mistake.Ginny stared at him with wide eyes for a good five seconds before bursting into laughter.“Ha – Harry!” she gasped between loud laughs. “That’s how you chose to broach the subject? Merlin, Harry, I swear – !”She was doubled over now and Harry could do nothing but feel his face growing hotter and hotter.“Oh, Harry, I’m sorry.” Ginny resurfaced with difficulty and smiled widely at him. “It’s just – was that the best way to introduce the idea?”Harry, face still hot, glowered at her.“I’m just going to wait for you to answer the question now,” he said stubbornly. It wasn't like he could take the words back, as much as he would've liked to.“What – if Malfoy’s fit?” She looked to be on the verge of hysterical laughter again but restrained herself with great effort. Her eyes were bright as she smiled at Harry. “I suppose, if you’re into scowly blonds. Oh, I should have known.”Harry’s curiosity was piqued.“Known what?”“That you’d be interested in him. Sodding Draco Malfoy. Remember when you talked about him all the time? Even when we were meant to be on dates, you’d burst out into the old ‘Malfoy looked suspicious today’ or ‘Malfoy didn’t say anything to me in the hall today.’”“I’ve never said anything of the sort.”“You keep telling yourself that,” Ginny smirked.He was embarrassed all over again and suddenly wanted to move on from the subject.“Whatever – even assuming that I did, what does that have to do with what’s happening now?”“Oh, come on, Harry, you’re not that daft,” Ginny rolled her eyes. “It has everything to do with now. Some part of you has always thought he was fit.”Harry was about to rebuke this fact, but Ginny beat him to it.“The longer you deny it, the harder it’s going to be to accept.”“I didn’t even know I liked blokes in Hogwarts!”“But now you do know, so you can look back and say, ‘oh, it's possible that I fancied Malfoy,’” she said, doing a passable imitation of his voice.“I don’t fancy –”Ginny raised a single eyebrow, and Harry fell silent, recognizing when a battle was lost.“Why can't I just have a simple life?" asked Harry, but all Ginny could do was pat him on the shoulder.

Chapter Text
When Draco met Blaise and Ginevra that night, he was reminded of just how alone he felt sometimes.Everyone he used to be close with were gone. Pansy and his mother had left the country, and Draco missed them terribly. He even missed his father some days. Growing up, Draco was never alone – he always had company, whether it was his parents, their many guests, or the parade of house-elves in their employ.Once he’d completed his make-up year at Hogwarts, Draco had lived alone for the first time in his life. He got a small flat in the outskirts of Wizarding London and went to medical school to learn how to become a Healer. He’d since upgraded flats, but he still woke alone every morning and went to bed alone every night. There was that lovely moment of time when he’d sometimes be accompanied by Leonel, but ever since their break-up, Draco had to get used to sleeping by himself all over again.He was brought out of his thoughts by Blaise’s murmurs and Ginevra’s laughs. Draco watched them for a moment, feeling achingly single and alone. He cleared his throat.“So how long will you be staying in London, Ginevra?” asked Draco, refusing to fall down that rabbit hole during dinner.She shrugged, frowning a bit as she glanced over at Blaise.“As long as Harry needs me, I suppose. I’m not really certain.”“I’ll be returning to Wales at the end of the month,” Blaise put in. His hooded eyes studied his girlfriend. “I’m assuming you won’t be back in New Zealand by then.”She bit her lip. “No, I guess not. I reckon I’ll stay with Mum and Dad until you,” she nodded at Draco, “think Harry’s strong enough to be on his own. I love Ron and Hermione, but they’re never tough enough on him. I…need to stay.”Blaise nodded, his arm wrapping around her shoulders. He smoothed her long hair away from her face carefully. Draco could easily see the adoration in Blaise’s eyes, something he never thought he’d witness.“I understand, love,” he said quietly.She relaxed into his chest, her head nestled beneath his chin.Draco dropped his eyes down to his food, their exchange once again reminding Draco just how much Potter’s situation was impacting everyone close to him.A hand was touching his face – a palm caressing his cheek.Draco raised his head and looked up, wanting to know whose hand it was. He met Leonel's dark eyes, and Leonel smiled gently."Draco."His name always sounded slightly peculiar when Leonel said it. It wasn't bad - just different."Yes?" Draco responded cautiously, his voice coming out like a breathy whisper.But Leonel said nothing; he moved to kiss him. Draco returned it, but the kiss felt strangely hollow. Perplexed, he pulled back and his heart stuttered violently in his chest.Potter was sat in front of him, staring at him with green eyes that were shockingly different from Leo's. His hand was now on Draco's face, right where Leonel’s had been a moment ago."What's wrong?" Potter asked, his voice smooth instead of gruff, like Draco was now used to.Draco opened his mouth to respond but instead woke up to the pitch black of his room.He was covered in a cold sweat and his heart was thudding loudly in his chest. Draco rubbed at his eyes a touch too aggressively, trying to make sense of his dream. They were hardly ever as vivid as that, and when they were, they veered more into nightmare territory.This was different. Potter hadn't starred in any of his dreams ever since he was eighteen.The dream left Draco shaken. He wanted desperately to forget it – Potter was a patient, for Salazar’s sake, and Leonel was no longer his. But no matter how hard he tried to focus on other things, the image of Potter staring at him tenderly floated to the forefront of his mind. It was just his luck that the one dream he wanted to forget insisted on staying, refusing to fade away like they usually did.Draco hadn’t been able to go back to sleep afterwards despite it being four o’clock in the morning. He tried in vain, rolling around in bed for a good half hour before giving up and heading to the bathroom. He pulled off the shirt that was stuck to his skin and the boxers that were caging his budding erection. Draco turned the tap so the water would be scalding hot, hoping to rub away the residual feeling of Potter's hand on his face.It didn’t work and he ended up wanking hard, desperately, his eyes shut tight until he came with a cry.Draco went into work early, figuring there was nothing else to do. He had downed two cups of coffee at home, hoping to mitigate the effects of the five hours of sleep he’d had, but headed to the employee lounge for another. Fortunately, there was no one in the lounge; it was early yet.He filled the kettle with water and left it to heat as he set up the drip mechanism. It was Muggle, yes, but as there were quite a few Muggleborn or Half-Blood employees, it needed to exist. And Draco found that he quite liked it. Once the water had finished boiling, he poured it over the ground coffee, watching as the water-turned-coffee sunk lower and lower, revealing the coffee grounds underneath.He was enjoying his second (small) mug of coffee when Ira came in. They blinked at Draco suspiciously, as if to check if he was really there, before walking into the lounge completely.“Good morning, Ira,” Draco greeted, straightening up a bit in his plastic chair.“Draco,” they said, offering a confused smile as they drew closer. “I didn’t think I’d find you in here so early. You’re not usually in at five, are you?”“No, I – couldn’t sleep,” said Draco, hoping his cheeks weren’t turning pink.“Oh?” Ira’s interest was piqued, and Draco was sure that his cheeks were flushed. “Why not? A dream, perhaps?”The way they said ‘dream’ made Draco feel dirty.“I just…”Draco wondered if it was worth the risk to confide in Ira. They were relatively trustworthy, yes, but loved to gossip. The person in question was fixing themselves a cup of tea, using the leftover water in the kettle.“Have you…ever had a dream about a patient?” Draco asked tentatively. “I’m certain you’re not referring to a perfectly innocent dream by the way your face has changed shades in just a minute’s time,” Ira said, slipping into the chair across from Draco’s with their tea, making Draco’s face even hotter. They bobbed their tea bag up and down, their pale eyes trained on it. “So my answer is no. You know I don’t see many patients anyway.”Draco sighed. It was true; Ira’s ward focused more on creating new potions or improving existing ones, not healing and curing patients.“But what’s so wrong about it? It’s just a dream, isn’t it? Dear Scarlett isn’t going to fire you for something your subconscious made up.”Draco put his head in his hands, wondering if his headache was due to excessive caffeine or all the agonizing.“I still feel so…guilty. And unclean,” Draco admitted, daring to meet Ira’s eyes for a second. They were frowning. “I shouldn’t be feeling this way for a patient.”“Oh, so there’s feelings attached?” Ira asked, leaning closer and voice changing. “It wasn’t just pure filth?”Draco sputtered and glared at Ira.“No, it wasn’t filthy in the slightest!” he exclaimed as loudly as he could in the environment. He relaxed and said softly, “It was quite the opposite, actually.”“So…?”“It’s morally wrong,” Draco explained, answering Ira’s silent question. “I’ve a duty to heal him and nothing more. It would be wrong to take advantage of him.”“Oh, Draco, you’re so much softer than I ever thought you would be,” Ira said.He squinted his eyes at them. “Is that a compliment?”Ira chose to ignore this question.“Who is it, if I may ask? I have someone on my mind, and I think this is the one person who would make sense. Considering you’ve already developed feelings for them.”Draco thought that even if he didn’t tell Ira, it would make no difference. They were perfectly right in saying Draco only had one patient who’d been in Draco’s care long enough for him to develop feelings in the first place.“It’s no use if I don’t tell you, correct?” he asked, voicing his thoughts with a sigh.“I imagine so.”“It’s…who you think it is,” Draco said when he’d gathered the nerve. “It’s Potter.”Ira let out a small laugh and shook their head in mild disbelief.“You had an emotionally intimate dream with the man and you still can’t say his first name?”“I – old habits die hard,” Draco said weakly.“Clearly.”“Don’t…tell anyone, alright?” he asked Ira after a moment of silence.They were in the middle of taking a sip and finished before replying.“I won’t,” Ira said sincerely.“Thank you.”“Except Betty, perhaps.”Draco rolled his eyes, already resigned to this fact.In between Draco’s talk with Ira and checking up on Potter, he decided that he should move on.It was just a silly infatuation, wasn’t it? Hogwarts was a long time ago and he didn’t even know the man who was in front of him now. They’d both changed in the past seven years. It was obvious.“Malfoy?”Potter’s gruff voice interrupted Draco’s swirling thoughts, making his neck heat up slightly.“Yes, I’m sorry,” Draco responded as professionally as he could.
Move on. 
“Where was I?”
He’s your patient.
“Ah – yes. Have you had any headaches today?”
It’s just a stupid little infatuation.
Potter looked at him strangely, opened his mouth, and shut it.He then said, “Yeah. Not that bad, though.”Draco wrote Potter's answer down, his hand gripping his quill so tightly he wondered if he might break it in half.“Any nausea?”Potter shook his head.“Good,” Draco said distractedly, his mind not letting him forget about his dream.He looked up at Potter, and he found his gaze dropping to Potter’s lips. They were full but chapped. Draco wondered what Potter would taste like.Potter shifted, obviously aware of Draco’s traitorous gaze.Draco cleared his throat. He looked pointedly into the famous green eyes.“And you slept well?”The irony was not lost on Draco.Potter nodded, his ability to speak apparently having gone away.“Excellent.”He scribbled the answer onto his parchment and smiled a little too forcefully.“Healer Estrada will be back in the evening to check on you once more.”Draco made to leave but was interrupted by Potter calling his name.“Yes?” he stopped in front of the closed door and directed his gaze at Potter, who was wringing his hands in his lap.“Is that appointment still happening? With, er, Dr. Wolff?”Something about the nervous way Potter said it, accompanied by those wide green eyes made Draco’s heart skip a beat.“Yes,” Draco said, forcing his voice to be normal. “It’s still set for the day after tomorrow at 10.”“Right. How will that work exactly?”“You will Floo to her office at the appointed time,” said Draco, finally sliding comfortably into professionalism. “My office is the closest access point, so you may use it for convenience. But if you have reservations about leaving St Mungo’s, Dr. Wolff is perfectly able to come here and have the session in here instead. I would simply have to let her know in advance.”“Oh.” Potter’s eyebrows scrunched together in thought. After a moment, he said, “I’ll go there. It’ll – er, be a nice change of pace.”“Yes, I can understand that,” Draco nodded. “I will come collect you five minutes to ten on Monday morning.”“Thanks, Malfoy.”It was only two PM, but Draco had been at work for nine hours already. He wondered if he could leave early. He’d already finished with his rounds, after all, and he had tomorrow off, barring emergencies. He could feel himself crashing, the caffeine only leaving him with a headache and tired eyes.Draco stared down at his half-finished report on Potter. Mitchell needed it by the end of the week, and for Draco, this was the end of the week. It was the last thing he needed to do before leaving – the final obstacle. He wondered if he could push through without one final cup of coffee, and decided that yes, he could.Working as quickly as he could, he wrote down what he’d observed since Potter had come in. He wrote down the symptoms Potter had suffered, when he’d had them, and to what degree. He wrote about Leonel and him preforming the cleansing procedure and its effects on Potter. He described how Potter would be seeing Dr. Wolff as a Mind Healer, and how Potter would most likely soon be released. He wrote and wrote and wrote, hoping it would be up to Mitchell’s high standards.Once he’d finished, he set down his quill and stretched out his cramped hand before reading over his work. Deeming it acceptable, he collected his belongings and left his office, report in hand. As he was locking his door, he locked eyes with Leonel. Draco muttered a curse under his breath as Leo stopped and waved a hand in greeting.“You’re leaving already, Healer?” Leonel asked amiably once he’d strode up to Draco.And of course Leonel looked exceptionally handsome today. Draco hadn’t seen him all day and would rather have not seen him at all, considering the state Draco was in – both physically and mentally.Leonel’s dark curls were swept back out of his face, save for the loose coil that never obeyed like the others did. He was clean-shaven and smelled discreetly like his American cologne. Draco had always preferred him with a beard, but Leonel liked to be shaved for work. And, well, he was fit either way.“Leo,” Draco greeted, offering him a tight smile. “Yes, I figured my presence wouldn’t be missed all that much.”“Oh, I don’t know about that,” Leo grinned, and Draco thought of how similar the sight was to his dream.He then wondered why Leonel and he had never shagged after breaking up. Just because they grew out of their relationship didn’t mean their sex had ever gotten worse.Draco arched an eyebrow. “Is that so?”Leonel’s eyes were bright as he smiled lopsidedly.“Yeah,” he said lowly, stepping closer so they were now only a foot apart. “I’d miss it.”Draco’s breath caught in his throat. A year ago, he would have pulled Leonel into his office where they’d have sex, rough and quick. But now, he didn’t know what to do.Did Leo actually want him again? Would it just be a one-off, or did he want to rekindle their relationship? Though, of course, Draco didn’t even know what he wanted himself. His subconscious seemed to desire both Leonel and Potter. At least with Leonel, he didn’t feel so damned guilty.Or maybe this was all meant to be friendly banter.Draco decided to go with the straight-forward approach.“What is it you want, Leo?” he asked quietly, staring into Leo’s dark eyes as he did so.Leonel met his gaze but didn’t answer right away.“I don’t know,” he finally said. “Would you…want to come over tonight?”Draco swallowed thickly. His skin tingled at the thought of another man touching him – he hadn’t pulled since they’d broken up, and if it was Leo himself who broke the spell…“Yes,” Draco answered, his voice weaker than he would have liked. “I’d like that.”A wolfish grin appeared on Leo’s face, sending shivers down Draco’s spine.“I’ll owl you.”

Draco let out a shaky breath as he read over the letter for the third time. He then hurried back to the bathroom so he could make sure he looked decent.Nowadays, he saw himself in the lime green robes more than anything, so it was a bit of a boost to his self-esteem when he wore Muggle clothing. He chose a simple fitted black T-shirt accompanied by a grey zip-up, and his favorite jeans that made his arse look incredible (in his humble opinion). He swept his hair out of his face even though it would get messed up from Apparition anyway.It'd been a long while since he'd gone over to any bloke's flat, and he was admittedly nervous. Draco checked his wristwatch - it was already 7:50. Draco had fallen asleep quickly after coming home, getting a good four and a half hours in. When he’d woken up, Leonel’s owl was watching Draco from his bedside table, irritated at having to wait so long. Draco had jumped to take the letter off its leg and read it quickly, having already expected Leo to contact him.Draco looked back up at his reflection. He had rolled up his sleeves in the heat of the moment and grimaced, quickly rolling them down again. The Mark was faint now, but to Draco, it always seemed to draw the eye.He wondered if Leonel would care if he was early. Probably, since Leonel would most likely be bringing takeout back home with him. He got off work at 7:30, after all, and was most likely just as hungry as Draco was.Draco paced around his flat for another five minutes before doing one last check in the mirror and Apparating outside Leonel’s complex.His body seemed to remember where to go more than he did. Draco followed his instincts into the building and up a set of narrow stairs before coming to a standstill at Leo's door. It'd been over a year since he'd stood in this exact spot, and he had to gather his courage before he knocked.The door flew open and Leonel stood behind it. The smell of Indian takeout wafted out as Leo smiled at Draco. He had evidently just gotten home; he’d only taken off his Healer robes, revealing the white shirt and dark wash jeans he had worn beneath them.“Hey,” said Leonel. He stepped back, making room. “Come in.”Draco did so. He looked around and saw little differences within the flat. More magnets on the fridge, a new calendar on the wall, and a new couch.“You look good, Draco,” Leonel said suddenly, causing Draco to swivel around and face him once more.“Thank you,” he said softly, unable to hide his smile. “You too, Leo.”“I look like I just got off work.” Leonel rolled his eyes. “Is Indian ok? I’m starving.”“Yes, that’s perfect.”As Leonel took plates and forks out of cupboards and drawers, Draco remembered something.“Oh, is your flatmate still living with you?”“Yeah, he’s out right now though,” Leonel responded with a grin. “He's with a girl.”Draco hummed in response.“You can help yourself to whatever you’d like,” Leonel said when he’d finished opening up all of the containers.“Thanks,” said Draco. He picked up a plate and began spooning food onto it, his mouth watering. “You’re a life-saver, Leo. I haven’t eaten since lunch.”“Really? What have you been doing?” He was fixing his own plate now, just inches away from Draco.“Sleeping,” answered Draco.Leonel laughed.“Man, I’m jealous. Do you want something to drink, by the way?” He rummaged around the kitchen, searching for beverages. “We’ve got…wine, some vodka…and…water.”It was Draco’s turn to laugh. “Wine, if that’s alright.”“Great, I’ll have some too.”Leo grabbed two wine glasses and an unopened red. Draco picked up both his and Leonel’s plates.“Where to?”“We can watch something.” Leo nodded in the direction of the television.They situated themselves on the new couch; Draco poured their wine as Leonel flicked through the channels. He settled on some type of true crime show.“Is this alright?”“As if we don’t see enough blood at work?” Draco asked. Leo made to change it, but Draco shook his head. “It’s fine, leave it.”They ate and watched as the true story of a triple-murder unfolded before them, complete with second-rate reenactments and poorly done narration.Three glasses of wine later and Draco was feeling rather buzzed. He gave up on watching the true crime show (they were on their third episode by now) and instead chose to lie back on the sofa’s armrest, cradling his fourth drink in his lap.Draco watched Leonel as he concentrated on the television. Leo was enraptured, his eyes glued to the screen, his chin dug into the palm of his hand. Draco could barely bite down his smile as he stared at the other man, enjoying the now rare sight of Leo relaxing at home.But then his dream from last night came to the forefront of his mind once more. What did it mean? Was it simply Draco finding both Leonel and Potter attractive? He knew that already – there was no need for divination. But did he actually like Leonel enough to start a relationship again? Or would they just shag and go back to normal? Was he using Leonel to forget about Potter? Because Draco did need to forget about him. He was a patient, and Draco his Healer. It would be all sorts of wrong to pursue Potter; Draco felt bad even thinking that Potter was fit. And even if this wasn’t their situation, he knew that Potter would never want him. For all he knew, he was still a snobby Death Eater in Potter’s mind. And of course, Potter had quite enough to worry about already, regardless.He was drawn out of his thoughts when he caught Leo’s eyes on him.Draco raised his eyebrows. “What?”“What were you thinking about?”Draco rolled his eyes.“I hate this game.”“I’m just curious, that’s all,” Leonel said, raising his hands in defense. “You looked pretty…lost in thought.”“I’m still,” Draco paused. He cocked his head, gazing at Leonel and trying to read him. “I don’t know what you want.”“Me neither,” Leonel confessed. He turned down the volume before swiveling in his seat to face Draco. “Do we have to know now? We could always figure it out later.”Draco’s throat was suddenly dry, and he took a nervous sip of wine. It didn’t help.“That’s true.”Leo came closer. Draco held his breath as Leonel took the glass out of his hands and set it on the coffee table. He parted Draco’s legs and crawled on top of him so they’d be face to face.Leonel had a five o’clock shadow now, and Draco itched to reach his hand up and touch his face. Bugger it, thought Draco, and he touched Leonel’s cheek lightly. Draco met Leo's eyes, and an unasked question hung heavy in the air. Leo’s eyes flickered from Draco’s own to his lips.And then they were kissing, gently. Leo tasted just as Draco had remembered, and Leo's soft lips and the scratch of stubble were just as familiar. Draco’s heart beat harder as he reached up to cup Leo’s face with his other hand. Leo grew more insistent and Draco reciprocated easily. It was just like it used to be, the way their tongues met and how Leo’s strong hands gripped Draco’s sides.When they’d run out of air, they parted though their hands remained where they were. Draco’s breaths were heavy as he stared up at Leo and became aware of his growing erection. He took his hands back and glanced away, embarrassed, and felt his face and neck go hot.“God, you’re hot,” Leonel murmured, his hands now traveling beneath Draco’s shirt.Draco made an undignified noise in response and his hips bucked – Draco was certain Leonel had felt his erection by now.He grabbed the front of Leonel’s shirt and pulled him down, their mouths crashing together roughly and without grace. By now, Leonel was exploring every inch of Draco, his fingers brushing over the denim covering Draco's hard cock. Draco moaned, the noise caught in their fervent kisses, and Leonel worked on unbuttoning and unzipping Draco’s trousers.Leo lowered Draco’s pants and stroked the length of Draco’s cock, making him gasp sharply and bite Leo’s bottom lip in retaliation. Leonel pulled back, his chest heaving as he looked Draco up and down.“Fuck, Draco. Can I blow you?”Draco nodded and sat up slightly.“Take that jacket off,” Leo commanded, and Draco complied easily, tossing it on the ground.Leo slunk down, satisfied, and wasted no time in taking Draco in his mouth.“Fuck.”Draco dug his hands into Leo’s shoulders and screwed his eyes shut as Leo swirled his tongue around Draco’s cock, his own hands grasping Draco’s thighs. Leonel sucked him off like an expert, taking him whole and sucking hard and licking and swirling and –“Mmph, Leo…”Leonel's mouth slipped away, and for a second, there was nothing. And then Leo’s hand grasped his cock firmly and began working it up and down, fast and rough. Draco found Leo’s hair and pulled hard. Leonel looked up at him and flashed that horrible wolfish grin, his eyes fixed on Draco’s own. Draco took a sharp intake of breath and managed to say, “Fuck me.”Leo’s hand stopped.“I thought you’d never ask.”Leonel stood and stripped, revealing defined abs and strong biceps. Draco watched him with hungry eyes, taking in every inch of Leonel’s body as he kicked off his trousers. God, and of course he was hung. Draco had almost forgotten.“What is it with American blokes and going to the gym?”Leo laughed and ran a hand through his curls. Draco stood and began to take his clothes off too.“What is it with British guys and being so pale and lithe?”“Bugger off,” muttered Draco through laughs.“I never said it was bad,” Leo said, coming closer and kissing Draco fiercely.Draco kissed him back before pulling him down onto the couch. He positioned himself; going on his hands and knees and looking back at Leo expectantly.“Come on.”Draco woke up from a deep sleep in Leo's bed. He smiled sleepily as he remembered the events of last night. They’d shagged on the couch before moving over to Leo’s bedroom lest his flatmate come back early. There, Draco rode Leo until they’d both finished again and fell into a deep sleep.His breath smelled rancid and his arse was exceptionally sore, but Draco stayed. He rolled onto his side and watched Leonel sleep, feeling an ache settle in his chest.Draco knew that they wouldn’t work out. He felt confident in it now, especially after last night. Yes, they made excellent colleagues and were more than compatible in bed, but as romantic partners? The love was long gone – if it had ever been love, that is. Leonel was intelligent and funny and caring and so bloody fit, but there was no spark. It made Draco feel ridiculous, but he really craved it. True love, or whatever it was. And he already knew he wouldn’t find it in Leo, no matter how much he had wanted to in the past.A small, sleepy grunt came from Leo, and he stirred in his sleep. Draco sighed, using his free hand to get the hair out of Leo’s face. The curls weren’t so tight now, thanks to Draco's insistent fingers, and looked a lot less lively because of it.Leo made another noise and blinked wearily, his eyes adjusting to the light and focusing on Draco.“Morning,” Draco greeted softly.“Mmph,” said Leo. “Morning, Draco. What time is it?”Draco’s watch was still on his wrist, thankfully.“Eleven.”“Jesus.” Leo rubbed at his eyes, then blinked a few times. “Have you been up long?”Draco shook his head no.Leonel looked at him knowingly and sighed. “You’ve thought about it, haven’t you? I’m guessing it’s a no.”Draco frowned and chose to focus on the walls instead of Leo.“Yeah, I thought it would be,” Leo went on since Draco refused to speak. “No worries. I think some part of me always knew that we were finished for good.”“I’m sorry,” Draco said quietly after a moment.He glanced cautiously at Leo. He didn’t seem mad.“I’m sorry too, Draco,” Leonel said, giving him a sad smile. “But at least we know, right?”“Yeah.”“And I don’t know about you, but I still had a good night.”Draco finally smiled, slightly.“I did too. You’re very mature for your age.”“Fuck off.” Leo rolled his eyes. “I’m only two years younger than you.”“I stand by what I said.”“Fine. Whatever. Old man.”

Chapter Text
Harry woke up on Monday morning filled with nervous excitement. His stomach felt dangerously unsteady and his brain was buzzing with anxiety.He shoved on his glasses, looked at the clock and saw, to his disappointment, that is was only half-past-seven. He was sleeping better now – being able to fall asleep relatively quickly and be uninterrupted until he woke – but it was still very early for him. His sleep schedule was all sorts of fucked before, and for good reason too. He just wondered when the real nightmares would come back.Breakfast was sitting on the bedside table under a warming charm, but Harry knew he was too anxious to eat; he felt like he could vomit at any moment. Not wanting to sit still, however, he decided he would take a shower to pass the time.Harry got up and looked down at himself. He was still wearing the rather depressing hospital gown and wondered if he’d be allowed to wear street clothes for the appointment. The clothes he was wearing when he came in had been cleaned, and didn’t Malfoy say that he might be able to leave today? Not that he really even wanted to, if he was being perfectly honest with himself.Ignoring this, Harry found his clean clothes folded neatly in the corner of an otherwise bare closet and grabbed them before heading to the shower.
True to his word, Malfoy knocked on Harry’s door at 9:55.Harry was already out of bed and standing, having been pacing for the past five minutes. Malfoy looked Harry up and down, noting his street clothes. Malfoy’s mouth quirked.“It’s alright, isn’t it?” Harry asked nervously.He crossed his arms, feeling vulnerable under Malfoy’s sharp gaze.“Yes, of course,” said Malfoy, his eyes finding their way back to Harry’s. “Well, are you ready?”Harry nodded.“I can cast a Disillusionment charm on you so you don’t draw any unwanted attention. Do you consent to me doing so?”Harry nodded again, and then Malfoy flicked his wand at him. It’d been years since he’d felt this particular charm wash over him, but it was just as strange now as it had been then. Harry looked down at himself and saw to his satisfaction that he was properly camouflaged.“Follow me, Potter.”Malfoy led the way out of the room, Harry walking hesitantly behind him. He’d been forced to stay in this hospital room for a week now, and now that the time had finally come to leave, he wasn’t particularly feeling at ease. He stopped at the door, peering out into the hallway apprehensively. A few people were walking hurriedly down them, one of them being Malfoy. Inhaling shakily, he stepped out into the hallway, out of the safe confines of the room.No one looked at him to his huge relief, and he shut the door gently before hurrying to catch up to Malfoy.Malfoy’s office, as it turned out, was not very far from Harry’s hospital room at all, and its door bore a shiny plaque reading “Healer Draco Malfoy – Head of Strife Feirold Ward.” Malfoy turned around and seemed to check if Harry was indeed behind him. Once he’d spotted him, Malfoy opened his door and let Harry walk past him into the office.Harry wasn’t sure what he had expected, but Malfoy’s office surprised Harry all the same. The walls were a spotless white and a small window provided the same view Harry had in his room. A sleek desk sat in the middle of the room, a little less organized than Harry would have figured it would be. There were three chairs in the office, one of which was Malfoy’s, and two plainer ones for guests. A bare coat rack stood in the corner, and next to it was the fireplace. A fire was already going, making the office a touch too warm.The door shut and Harry swiveled around, momentarily forgetting that Malfoy was right behind him. Malfoy approached him with his wand drawn. A light panic set in, Harry having seen much too many wands pointed right at him.“Finite incantatum,” said Malfoy, and Harry relaxed, feeling the Disillusionment charm wearing off him.“Thanks,” said Harry quietly.Malfoy checked his wristwatch. “It’s one minute to ten. Are you ready?”Harry shrugged.Malfoy gave a small smile and said, “You’ll be fine, Potter.”Before Harry could respond, Malfoy had gone to the fireplace and thrown Floo powder into the fire.“Just say ‘Dr. Julia Wolff’s office,’” advised Malfoy.Harry nodded, took a deep breath, and walked into the large green flames.“Dr. Julia Wolff’s office,” Harry called out as clearly as he could manage.He shut his eyes and the fire took him far away from Malfoy’s office, dumping him out onto a carpeted floor.Harry opened his eyes and looked up into the face of a kind-faced white woman. He scrambled up, dusting the ash off himself.“Er, sorry,” Harry said, grimacing down at the mess he’d made.“It is no problem, Harry,” Wolff assured with a slight smile. Her voice was low, smooth, and punctuated by a German accent. She held out her hand. “I am Doctor Julia Wolff. It is nice to meet you.”Harry shook her hand, hoping there wasn’t a horrible mixture of ash and sweat on his palm.“Nice to meet you too.”"Let us sit down," she said when she let go of his hand, gesturing to the chairs in the room.Harry took a seat in the guest chair and gazed around the office. Framed academic certificates hung on the wall, a small calendar next to them. Her wooden desk was neatly organized, a large paper calendar taking up a quarter of it.Wolff sat down in her seat across from Harry. He couldn't easily identify her age; she could have been anywhere from 35 to 45 years of age. Her face was lined faintly, and there were grey strands of hair in between the hazelnut. Her brown eyes were soft as they regarded him."I suppose I should introduce myself," she said. "As I said, I am Doctor Wolff. I am a licensed psychiatrist and Mind-Healer in both Germany and England. I was born and raised in Köln and came to London in the mid-90s. I am also a Squib, if you were curious to know."Harry wouldn't say it aloud, but he was curious. He wondered what kind of witch would study what was widely a Muggle profession."Would you like to tell me a bit about yourself?"Harry thought for a moment."Well, you said you came over in the 90s, right?" Harry asked, and when she nodded, he said, "Then I reckon you already know who I am.""I would like your own version of yourself, not a newspaper's or history book’s version.""There's not much to know," he said shortly.He really didn't want to give her an introduction about himself - it felt redundant and ridiculous."Then perhaps we shall start with why you are here in the first place," she prompted patiently.Harry gave a light scoff."That's tied in with who I am, to be honest.""Well, Harry - is it alright to call you by your Christian name?"He nodded, and she continued."Harry, I do have your files right here," she patted a packet labeled "CONFIDENTIAL" that sat threateningly on her desk, "But like I said, I'd rather hear your account of what's happened.""So you're saying you haven't read it?" Harry challenged."I have," she responded calmly, "But I'd like to fill in the gaps by talking to you.""I woke up in Mungo's. Looks like I walked myself over while inebriated and just...passed out.""Where did you walk from?""I reckon home, but it's a bit far...""You're not certain?"Wolff was now taking notes in small notepad with a Muggle pen, he noted with interest."I can't have Apparated - even when I'm drunk or high I have enough sense to know it would end badly.""And you were both drunk and high that night?""It's likely. I blacked out," Harry admitted reluctantly. He chewed on his lip. "That's usually how it goes.""What sort of potions did you take?"He shut his eyes, trying his best to remember. The memories of that day were either fuzzy or not there at all."Just calming stuff. It’s all in my file, I reckon.""Did you ever use illegal Muggle substances?"Harry paused, and said slowly, "When I had the means. It wasn't too, er, often.""What types of substances?"Harry shifted in his seat and chose to look at the wall instead of Wolff. He was embarrassed; he’d never talked about this before. Ron and Hermione most likely knew even though he’d never admitted it out loud to them – as far as he knew, anyway."Mostly downers. Cannabis, benzos...but sometimes I'd use cocaine or ecstasy for er, special occasions."He wiped his palms down his jeans, finally managing to make eye contact with her once more. Her face was still perfectly neutral, reminding Harry of Malfoy."What sort of special occasions?""I dunno, if I was in a Muggle club or something like that. It's been a while, though."Wolff nodded. "That's good."Harry shrugged.“Do you not agree?"He thought, then said truthfully, "I mean, I miss it sometimes. But sure, it's great."“You’ve been clean for seven days, Harry. You should be proud of yourself."Harry scoffed."It's no easy feat, Harry," Wolff said firmly, looking him square in the eye. "Addiction is a disease like any other. It will be fighting you every step of the way.""It's fine when I'm in hospital, y'know?" Harry said after a moment. "But I don't know if I'll be able to keep, er, clean when I'm back home. I could never quit before cos it was so easy to just - give in."Wolff watched as he spoke, nodding at the right intervals. She wrote something down, and then said,"I am certain Mungo's would be happy to accommodate you for the time being. Do you have someone to keep you accountable?"Harry thought of Hermione and Ron."I suppose, but I still live by myself. They can't be with me all the time.""In that case, I do recommend staying at St Mungo's until you feel a bit confident in leaving."Harry nodded, biting his lip.
At the end of the hour, Wolff shook his hand again and told him that she looked forward to seeing him again next week.“Thanks, me too,” Harry replied, managing a smile.They both stood up, and Wolff began escorting Harry to her fireplace when he stopped suddenly. He turned to face her, and she looked at him expectantly.“Sorry, I just have a question,” Harry said. “Are you going to tell Malfoy about, er, everything?”“Healer Malfoy?” Wolff asked, her eyebrows raised.What other Malfoy is there? thought Harry as he nodded.“No, Harry,” Wolff said. “I take patient confidentiality very seriously and I will only repeat what you’ve said if you are intending to hurt yourself or someone else.”Relief flooded through him. He didn’t want anyone to know what went on in his mind, least of all Malfoy. It was strange enough spilling his long-kept secrets to a virtual stranger.“Right. Thanks, Dr. Wolff.”She smiled at him kindly. “You’re welcome, Harry. You have a good day now.”Harry thanked her and Flooed back to Malfoy’s office. He tumbled out, landing gracelessly on his hands and knees on the cold tiled floor. It smarted slightly, and he winced.“Welcome back, Potter.”Harry’s face went hot as he stood up and brushed himself off. His hands trembled lightly as he wiped his glasses clean with his shirt. He felt strangely vulnerable and raw after that hour with Wolff, and he wasn’t certain if he was stable enough to deal with Malfoy just yet.When he put the glasses back on, Malfoy came into focus. His expression was strangely soft as he looked up at Harry from his desk.“Er, thanks,” Harry finally said, once again unsettled by Malfoy showing human emotions.“Are you alright?” Malfoy asked, his grey eyes fixed on Harry.“Yeah, fine, Malfoy.”Malfoy frowned but stood and withdrew his wand.“Would you like me to escort you back to your room?”Harry nodded, and Malfoy cast the Disillusionment charm once more. The walk back to Harry’s room was quick and soon they were inside. Malfoy undid the charm.“Thanks,” Harry said again.“You’re welcome, Potter.”Harry sat on the side of his bed and stared down at the floor, not yet comfortable looking Malfoy in the eye. What must he be thinking right now?“Do you need anything, Potter?” came Malfoy’s voice, soft and gentle. Harry looked up, startled – he couldn’t believe that that tone of voice was coming from Malfoy. “I can firecall Weasley and Granger over if you’d like to talk to someone. Or, of course, you could spend some time alone before I come back to check your vitals.”“Er,” Harry said, uncertain of what he wanted.He still felt shaken up, but he knew Hermione and Ron would be anxious to know how the appointment had gone. Harry had told them about it yesterday during their visit, feeling strange as he did so. Hermione and Ron took it in stride, however, and reassured him that it was the right thing to do. Still, he didn’t know if he could handle the both of them right now.“I think I just want to…be alone for a bit,” Harry said when he’d made up his mind.“Of course, Potter,” said Malfoy. “I’ll return in a few hours, but if you need anything sooner, let us know.”Harry glanced over at the glowing button before nodding.Malfoy left without another word, his only goodbye the soft click of the door as it closed.
Harry took a deep breath. It was now or never. He had to let them know, get it all out in the open, and make it the past. This is what happened, but it won't happen again, I swear."Ron, Hermione, I have to tell you something," Harry began, and he already felt his heartbeat thudding in his temples. He exhaled, though it didn’t help much. "It's about Dr. Wolff, sort of.""What is it, mate?" Ron asked, face serious."I, er...I wasn't just using potions or alcohol." He bit his bottom lip and his gaze started to wander. He settled on looking at his hands as he said haltingly, "I also...sometimes used some Muggle drugs.""Oh," breathed Hermione.Harry forced himself to face his friends. He wondered if they would look down on him or hate him or feel like they didn't even know him. Hermione's eyes were wide and her brows were furrowed, her mind probably working a kilometer a minute. Ron, however, simply looked stunned. His mouth was working, but nothing came out of it."Oh, Harry, when?" Hermione asked, moving closer to him. "How?"Ron nodded in silent agreement of the questions, watching the two of them carefully.Harry ran a hand through his hair and looked off at the wall, trying to remember when he'd first used Muggle drugs."It might have been...the first time was probably a year ago," Harry said slowly, shivering as he recalled the memory. "I was at a Muggle club. And this er, this bloke I was dancing with went in the loo. After a minute or two I got tired of waiting so I followed him in there. And he was uh, doing a line. Of cocaine. And he saw me and offered me a bump and I thought, why not..."Harry drifted off, embarrassed. He still remembered his first time – how he’d felt self-conscious in front of the bloke, and how horrible it had tasted afterwards. Most of all, he remembered how great it had felt."Cocaine?" Hermione echoed, slightly horrified.The expression on her face sent an icy dagger through Harry's heart, dissolving the happy memory. He'd disappointed Hermione before, but never like this. Never to this extent. His jaw clenched as he nodded."What's that?" Ron was asking quietly, but Harry's pulse was so loud that he could barely concentrate on what they were saying.He half-heard Hermione explain what it was, making Harry feel even worse. His face was burning up more and more as she spoke, and soon he felt like he was drowning in shame."What else, Harry?"Her voice was clipped, and Harry looked down at his lap."Benzos, cannabis, and ecstasy," he choked out, staring hard at his hands. "They were from people I just met in clubs before they turned into, er..."Dealers, his mind supplied helpfully.Hermione exhaled. Harry wondered what would come next."You're safe now, right, Harry? You're not in touch with any of those people anymore?"Harry shook his head, his throat too tight to speak."I'm glad. And I’m glad that you're alright."Her voice was softer now, and Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He looked up to say something, but as soon as he did so, Hermione straightened up and said firmly, "But Harry Potter, if I ever see you with any drugs at all, I'll march you to Dr. Wolff's office myself."Harry let out a watery laugh and nodded. "That's fair."Hermione's arms were around him then, hugging him so tight he could hardly breathe. He hugged her back, holding onto her as his hands trembled and eyes filled with tears, relieved that the weight was finally off his shoulders.
"How are you feeling?"Malfoy stood in front of him, clipboard in hand and quill at the ready. Harry was sat on the bed, cross-legged and over the covers, still wearing the Muggle clothes he had come in with.Harry was feeling especially vulnerable now. Letting go of your secrets and revealing them to a Mind-Healer and his two best friends turned out to be exhausting."I'm alright."Malfoy frowned. "Any symptoms out of the ordinary?""No," Harry answered.The frown deepened."Are you certain? You look a bit peaky."Harry scoffed. "Thanks, Malfoy."He turned his head away from Malfoy and opted to look out the window again. Apparently, there was a charm on it so patients could see outside it, but anyone on the other side couldn’t look in. Betty had told him that one morning.A silent breeze shook the bushes and trees, and Harry longed to feel it on his skin."I didn't mean offense, I simply meant –" Malfoy retaliated, giving an impatient sigh."I know,” Harry said. He chewed on his lip before turning his gaze back to Malfoy. “I'm fine, I promise. I'm not nauseated or anything. Just a little headache."Malfoy didn't look completely convinced but he let it drop."I've received word from Dr. Wolff that you will be staying here until you feel comfortable leaving," Malfoy said instead."That's alright, isn't it?""Yes, of course. You won’t be able to stay here forever, though, just so you know. Will this room be acceptable? We could move you upstairs to the more long-term -"The image of Neville's parents flashed in his mind."No. No," Harry said, lowering his voice. "I'd rather stay here."Malfoy nodded. "Very well. I'll let the department head know. Is there anything else I can do for you at the moment?"Harry paused, then asked, “How long am I able to stay, then?”“While we do evaluate patients on a case-by-case basis, hospital policy dictates that patients can stay for a maximum of two weeks if they aren’t in mortal danger.”Harry exhaled. One more week before he was released back into the world. Before he was released as a sober man with what felt like an impossible task: staying sober.“Yeah, alright.” He looked Malfoy square in the eye. “Good.”Malfoy seemed slightly taken aback by Harry’s sudden determination, but simply smiled.“If that’s all for now, I’ll take my leave, and someone will be back to check on you later tonight.”Harry nodded. “Thanks.”“You’re welcome, Potter,” said Malfoy before turning to leave the room. He opened the door and said, “Oh. Ginevra. It’s good to see you.”Harry peeked around Malfoy’s figure curiously, and sure enough, Ginny was standing in the doorway in a soft-looking Muggle sweater and jeans.“You too, Malfoy,” she grinned. She stood on her tiptoes and looked past Malfoy, making eye contact with Harry. “Hi, Harry. Is now a good time?”“Sure.”Malfoy stepped back so Ginny could enter the room, and with a final nod, he left and closed the door behind him.Ginny walked closer to him, her brown eyes looking him up and down carefully.“You look good, Harry,” she said kindly, “And I see you’ve finally gotten out of that hospital gown.”“Er, yeah,” Harry mumbled, glancing down at himself. “Thanks.”Ginny sat down in one of the chairs. “How are you doing?”“I’m fine, Gin,” Harry told her. He paused a second, then said, “I wish I could go outside.”“Huh?”“It’s been a week since I’ve been outside,” Harry said. He was looking out the window again, watching the leaves shift and move together gracefully, each one in sync with the next. And then he started talking and couldn’t stop the words from coming out. “It’s sort of…before, I’d stay in for – who knows how long and not even care. But now my mind’s clear again and I have to live and be present for every second I’m awake and I hate it but it’s also…nice in a way.“I know what I’ve been missing now. Even little things, like fresh air, or being able to think without puking or sweating or my heartbeat going so fast I can feel it throughout my entire body. But I’ve also been missing you. You and Ron and Hermione and everyone else. I’ve been missing your lives and it was so bloody selfish of me, but I want to be here for it now. It finally makes sense. I want to be the friend you all deserve.”He turned away from the window, and Ginny, beautiful Ginny, had tears running down her face.“Oh,” he said, and reached out to wipe them away.Before he could do it though, she did it herself, roughly and impatiently, and sniffled.“Harry,” she whispered, her voice thick. “I’m…”“Sorry,” he mumbled. He watched as she wiped fresh tears away, her brown eyes red. “I should have warned you before all that.”Ginny gave a short laugh and shook her head. “No. No, Harry, I’m glad you told me. I was just surprised, is all.”Harry couldn’t think of anything to say, and so he didn’t.“What made you change your mind?”He bit his lip, thinking.“I don’t think I’ve been this clear-headed in a long time…and I had my first appointment with a Mind Healer today and it made me realize what I was missing out on. And how I’ve been hurting you all and I’m just tired of it. I still hate being sober, Ginny, but I reckon I have to be. I can’t keep doing this.”The last few words choked Harry’s throat as they came out, and then he felt like he may cry as well.Ginny moved from the chair to the bed, sitting next to him so their thighs touched. She took Harry’s hand in her own and leaned her head against his shoulder, the smell of her hair wafting up towards Harry’s face. He squeezed her hand, and she squeezed back.“Do you think they’d let you go outside?” asked Ginny softly after minutes of silence, their slow breaths the only sounds in the room.It took him a second to remember what she was talking about, or rather, what he was talking about.“I dunno,” he said. “Maybe. But even if they did, I’d still be worried that someone would recognize me.”Ginny lifted her head, and Harry turned to meet her gaze.“What if I brought the Cloak?” she asked, a small grin on her face.“Oh,” Harry said. He hadn’t even thought of that. “Yeah, I s’pose that would work. Do you know where it is?”“It’s your Cloak, isn’t it?”He rolled his eyes. “Yeah, but that doesn’t mean I know where it is. I don’t even know when the last time I saw it was.”“Don’t worry about it,” Ginny told him. “I’ll find it for you, and then you can take a stroll outside ‘round Muggle London.”Harry considered this. She was right – with the Cloak, he’d be able to go outside without having to worry about being seen. His heartrate sped up at the thought of finally being able to see something other than the walls of his hospital room. Still, something was holding him back.“Would you…could you come with me?”“Of course, Harry,” Ginny smiled. “I’ll go to yours and look for the Cloak today, alright?”“Yeah, that’d be great. Thanks, Ginny.”She smiled wider and winked. “Anything for my favorite ex-boyfriend.”

Chapter Text
Tuesday night found Draco working late into the night, and on bureaucratic paperwork, no less. If he was working on treating a patient, he would be wholly and completely dedicated, not caring if he had to stay up until two in the morning. But instead, it was useless, tedious paperwork that would no doubt be shoved into a file once he was done, never to be seen again.He supported the generous donation that the Ministry of Magic had gifted to St. Mungo’s, but really did not appreciate the radical increase of paperwork that came with it all. Draco could have done without that bit. Scarlett sympathized with his struggles, but firmly insisted that he put forth his best effort to appease the Ministry.Draco finished a sentence and stopped, putting his quill into his ink pot. He shook out his cramped hand as he tried to force his brain to cooperate. He was so exhausted that he wasn’t even really certain of what he was writing. His vision blurred slightly as he started down at the parchment. Blinking furiously, he stretched out his back and relished in the feeling of his spine being straightened. He exhaled sharply as several loud cracks broke the empty silence.Right. Coffee.Draco stood, yawning as he did so, and pulled his Healer’s robes on over his white Muggle button-up and black trousers. He walked stiffly out of his office and made his way to the employee lounge on the eastern side of the floor.Just get it done tonight so you don’t have to worry about it anymore, Draco reminded himself silently.He hugged his arms around himself – the hallways were colder than Draco’s office was – and felt a chill run through his body. He was about halfway there when he heard a soft noise coming from behind him. He paused and frowned, looking back. Seeing nothing, he chalked it up to a patient rustling around in one of their rooms.Draco resumed walking but stopped again only ten seconds later. No, the noise definitely wasn’t coming from a room – it was following him. His tired brain suddenly awake and alert, he reached into his robes and grabbed hold of his wand. Draco drew it slowly as he scanned his surroundings. He didn’t see anything, but there had to be something here. A patient trying to escape? A thief, looking for potions to steal?“Who’s there?” he asked sharply, his voice cutting into the stiff silence.Nothing. He drew his wand out completely and pointed it into the empty air in front of him. It was too dark to see clearly, though, so he silently cast lumos and watched his immediate area light up before him.“I warn you, I’m authorized to use moderate hexes on intruders in order to protect – ““I see your detecting skills have gone unused,” said a familiar voice. “I expected better from you, Malfoy.”A figure appeared a few meters away from him, and Draco reflexively pointed his wand at it. He blinked, then,“Potter?”And sure enough, there he was, dressed in a plain white shirt and dark sweatpants.“Wh-what are you doing awake? Out here? And following me?” Draco asked, taken aback.
And where did you get those clothes? 
Potter ignored these questions and instead said, “Could you put that down?”“Nox,” Draco said quickly, and his wand’s light disappeared.The dimly lit hallways made it difficult for Draco to see the other man, and he briefly wondered if it was just his sleep-deprived brain playing a cruel trick on him. He stowed the wand away in his robes, utterly dumbfounded. He then took a hesitant step forward.“Are you alright, Potter?”“Yeah,” Potter said, finally answering one of Draco’s many urgent questions. He crossed his arms. “Sorry, I didn’t mean to scare you.”“Potter…” Draco was getting more concerned by the second.“I’m not having a psychotic break, alright? Just the normal amount of mental,” Potter told him with a frown. “I couldn’t sleep, so I thought I’d just, er, walk around.”“And follow me?” Draco asked, bemused.“You shouldn’t be that surprised by it, Malfoy.”Draco gave a weak chuckle. “I suppose.”This wasn’t really happening, was it?“But are you sure you’re alright?” Draco asked again. He took a few more steps until he was half a meter away from Potter. “Aside from the insomnia, is there anything else you’re experiencing?”“You don’t need to do that right now.”“Do what? My job?” Draco asked, raising his eyebrows.“I’m fine,” Potter said a touch impatiently. “I don’t want to talk about that right now. I need – I need a distraction.”There it was.Draco regarded Potter for a moment and weighed the pros and cons of his idea.When he made up his mind, he said, “Follow me.”Draco started walking without waiting for Potter, but sure enough, he heard the sound of footsteps behind him after a few moments. He took the both of them to the employee lounge; after unlocking and opening the door, he switched on the lights and allowed Potter passage. He watched as Potter walked inside, blinking blearily and looking around. Draco followed him in and shut the door behind him.“I’m going to make myself coffee,” Draco said, breaking the silence. He looked round at Potter, who was standing uncomfortably near the table in the center of the room. “Would you like anything?”“Tea. Chamomile, if there’s any,” Potter answered.Draco opened up a cabinet and retrieved the box of chamomile.“I think this line of work requires the presence of relaxing tea,” Draco said. He glanced at him again. “You can sit down, Potter.”“Er, right. Thanks.”Draco watched as Potter sat in a chair, his shoulders tense, and something like affection tugged at Draco’s heart. He shook it off and returned to his task of making drinks.A few minutes later, Draco joined Potter at the table and set their respective mugs in front of them.“Thanks,” Potter said again softly, wrapping his hands around his tea.Draco’s gaze lingered on them, admiring the masculine shape of them.He wanted to slap himself.“You’re welcome,” Draco said, and took a sip of his coffee.He cocked his head as he studied Potter’s face. What kind of distraction did he need? Salazar knew he looked tired, though tired wasn’t even the right word for it. His exhaustion seemed to be bone-deep, permeating his entire being.“So how did you sneak up on me so well?”Potter’s mouth twitched in amusement. He released the tight grip he had on his mug and took something out of his sweatpants pocket, holding it out for Draco to see it. Draco leaned closer – it was shimmery, a fabric, maybe? And then it registered in his mind, bringing him right back to Hogwarts, and to the Hogwarts Express.“Merlin,” breathed Draco. He reached out to touch it, then remembered himself.“You can touch it. Here,” Potter said, extending it even further.Draco frowned. Would he really let him touch it? The Cloak of Invisibility?Potter nodded reassuringly, and Draco hesitantly reached out fully and stroked the Cloak, surprised by how worn-out it felt.“Wow,” Draco said, lost for words.“I forgot you’ve seen it before. I mean, you’ve even touched it before,” Potter said conversationally. He put it down on the table and went back to gripping his tea.“Yes,” Draco swallowed tightly. “Me too.”“Mad to think about, isn’t it?” Potter said wryly. “If someone told me ten years ago that I’d be sitting and having a cuppa with Draco Malfoy at two-thirty A.M. without trying to kill each other, I would’ve laughed in their face.”A chill ran through his entire body when Potter said his first name. He tried to focus on the context in which he’d said the word instead of the word itself.“I think I would’ve cursed them, so I’ve got you beat,” Draco countered.His heart lifted ever-so-slightly when Potter grinned at that.“Yeah, I reckon so,” Potter conceded.Draco took a sip of coffee, internally cursing himself for absolutely and without a doubt having feelings for Harry bloody Potter.But it wasn’t Draco’s fault. Potter was handsome in an unconventional way with his untamable hair and the curve of his nose and his unusually bright green eyes and the way they contrasted with his dark skin. He was simply mesmerizing. Draco had been mesmerized ever since he’d met the prat and he doubted that it would ever stop. Draco was certain he could still recall all the quirks and habits of Potter’s that he’d picked up on during Hogwarts. Even now, Draco was committing the sight of a sleepy Harry Potter in a loose shirt and sweatpants to memory.And it didn’t help at all that he was a hero who literally saved the world (and Draco’s nearly worthless life).  “Why are you awake?”It took a moment for Draco to register what Potter was saying, and another moment to respond.“Work.”“And you’re drinking coffee right now?”Draco nodded.“You’re the bloody Head Healer though, aren’t you? Can’t you leave it for tomorrow? It’s going to be three soon.”Draco rubbed at his eyes. “I just want to finish it. It’s just tedious paperwork, nothing difficult or challenging. I would just have to do it tomorrow if I don’t suck it up and do it tonight.”“Or you could just sleep,” said Potter. “No offense, Malfoy, but you look like shite.”Though he knew Potter was joking, it stung. He bristled.Potter must have noticed, because he added on, "But I'm the one here who's a drug addict, so I reckon I shouldn't be making judgements."Draco ducked his head and grimaced, uncertain of what to say. Ever since Potter had arrived at St. Mungo's, Draco's world had been knocked off-kilter.“Potter, I -” he began, though he had no idea where he was going to go with that sentence.But Potter saved him from having to figure it out by interrupting him.“Sorry. I've been making bad jokes lately, apparently. I gave Ginny a bad combination of a heart attack and guilt trip all in one a few days ago.”“It's - ah, alright,” Draco said quietly. “You just...caught me off guard.”He met Potter's eyes, his heart pounding rapidly in his chest. The expression on Potter's face was indiscernible as he stared intently at Draco. He shifted under Potter's intense gaze.“I want to say sorry, Malfoy,” Potter finally said when the silence had become suffocating. Draco's eyes widened. “For being such an arse when I first came in. It's obvious that you've changed and I...understand now.”“Understand what?” Draco asked hesitantly.“Why you're friends with Ron and Hermione and Ginny,” said Potter. “I didn't know why they would be so accepting of you, but now I realize it's because I only had the image of you at seventeen. Not the...you now.”Draco felt his face flush aggressively at that. He desperately wanted to forget everything about the War, and nowadays, he hardly heard it brought up in conversation. And now Potter of all people was talking about what he was like when he was seventeen years old.“Apology accepted, Potter,” Draco said uncomfortably. “It's hardly the worst I've been treated by a patient.”“Really?”And Merlin bless him, he actually looked surprised.“The majority of patients that come through my department are poisoned, which tends to affect their moods. Others recognize my name and treat me accordingly. And some fall into both categories.”“Sorry,” Potter frowned, knowing he had been both.“Like I said, I've had worse. Don't concern yourself with it.”“Alright," Potter said, but he was still frowning. “Still, I'm sorry. I reckon I was insufferable.”Draco forced down a smile. “It's fine, really. It's not like it was any different from back in Hogwarts.”Potter let out a short laugh.“You're one to talk.”Draco shrugged.They finished their drinks in comfortable silence (something he never imagined would happen with them) before leaving. Draco closed the door shut behind them and locked it once more with his wand. He turned to Potter who now stood next to him, hands in pockets.“Well, as enjoyable as this was, Potter, I've got to finish my paperwork. And you should really try to get some sleep.”“Unlikely,” Potter sighed. “It's like I've forgotten how to sleep without all the potions.”Draco looked at Potter, his heart aching for him. He'd seen many times how long and turbulent the road to recovery was and knew for a fact that there was no easy way out. Now more than ever, Draco wished that there was.“You'll remember again.”Draco woke up hugely disoriented the next morning. He vaguely remembered doing paperwork, going to lounge, talking to Potter, finishing up work, and Flooing home around four. He rolled over to check the wristwatch sitting on his nightstand – it was just past eleven.He laid flat on his back again and let out a loud sigh.There was no denying it. He couldn’t push it down, he couldn’t ignore it, and he couldn’t wish it away. He fancied Potter. His ex-schoolboy nemesis. His patient. What was wrong with him?He wondered if Ira was going to be in today. Draco hoped they would be because he really needed to talk to someone about this.Draco reluctantly got out of bed and went to take a shower.When Draco arrived at his office, he left immediately for Ira’s.Draco knocked on the closed door of Ira’s office and heard their “come in!” a second later. He turned the knob and stuck his head in. Ira was sat at their desk, furiously scribbling on parchment.Clearing his throat, Draco asked, “Is this a bad time?”Ira looked up. “Oh! No, come in. Please. I’ll just take another moment.”Draco obeyed and walked inside, closing the door and sitting in the chair opposite Ira. He watched as they finished up what looked to be a rough draft of a potions recipe. Ira exhaled with a broad smile and looked up at Draco.“How can I help you, Draco?”“I need to talk to you,” Draco admitted. He felt his eyebrows pinch together. “About non-work-related matters.”Ira seemed to understand immediately – they were clever like that.“Ah. Yes, of course,” Ira nodded. “Have you eaten yet? We can get a bite to eat while you tell me what you need to.”Draco sagged with relief. “That would be brilliant.”They both took off their lime Healers robes, leaving them hanging on Ira’s standing coat rack, exited St. Mungo’s, and walked the short distance to a homey Muggle café. After ordering sandwiches, the two of them sat down at a corner table. A waitress brought their food and drinks over a few minutes later, and when they’d both had a few bites of food, Draco decided to start.“It’s about Potter.”Ira nodded. “Naturally.”“We had an actual…conversation yesterday. Early this morning, if you want to be technical.”Ira cocked their head, and Draco continued.“I was doing paperwork at around two and was heading to the lounge for coffee when I heard something behind me. And it was bloody Potter underneath that bloody Cloak of his.”“Cloak?”“I’m certain you’ve heard the rumors. The myth,” Draco rolled his eyes, “That Potter has a Cloak of Invisibility. As in the one from Tales. Well, it’s true, and Potter was using it to follow me around in the dead of night.”Ira gave a loud burst of surprised laughter.“Brilliant! I love it! What happened next?”“I was puzzled, as I think anyone would be, and asked him why he was lurking about and following me. He said he needed a distraction.” Draco frowned at this. “So I took his to the lounge and made him tea.”“How nice of you,” Ira smirked, taking a sip of their own tea.“Not really. I didn’t know what would help him. I took a gamble, and I think it paid off. It’s just – looking at him, you can see the sadness radiating from him. It’s –“Draco cleared his throat and looked away, his eyes suddenly stinging. He was surprised at himself, and it seemed that Ira was too. He clenched his jaw and blinked rapidly, willing himself not to actually tear up. He focused on his cappuccino and sandwich instead of on Ira, and suddenly realized that he wasn’t hungry anymore.“I’ve treated lots of addicts,” Draco finally continued in a low voice, “But I’d never known one so personally. And for it to be Potter…it’s just even more shocking to me. He’s thrown me off my balance and I don’t know what to do or say anymore. It used to be so easy – they were just patients. I was just their Healer. But now…”Draco met Ira’s gaze again; the soft expression on their face implored Draco to go on.“You saw what he looked like that first day. I’d seen him in bad shape before…several times, even. But before all this, he was never a real person to me. Just an annoying pain in the arse who was too famous for his own good. And now I’m learning something new about him every day and seeing that his life is far from perfect.”“And then on top of all this, you fancy him,” Ira finished simply.Draco nodded, hating himself.“It’s all fucked.”“Well…yes, it’s not the prettiest or most clear-cut situation, but it’s not the end of the world, Draco,” Ira said.“It’s fucked,” Draco said again.“Look, you’re doing your job. You’re a Healer, and you’re helping him as best you can to get healthy. You haven’t made any advances – that I know of, at least – so you certainly haven’t crossed any ethical boundaries. Just keep doing what you’re doing and you’ll be perfectly fine.”“But what about what happened last night?” Draco asked Ira. “That certainly isn’t normal. I’ve never done that with any other patient before.”“You did what you did because the situation was forced upon you,” Ira argued. “You didn’t hunt Mr. Potter down and demand that he join you for a mid-morning coffee date. You listened to what he was saying and helped him out. Sure, the outcome may have been a bit different if it wasn’t Mr. Potter, but I don’t think your actions were out of bounds. Not by a long shot.”Draco sighed. The anxiety that had been wrapping his chest and stomach in knots loosened its hold, and Draco felt like he could breathe a bit easier.“Alright,” he said. “Right. I suppose I believe you.”“You really should,” Ira advised with a smile. “You’ll feel loads better.”“I do already, as a matter of fact,” Draco said truthfully. “Though I still won’t be able to finish this. Do you want it?”He gestured towards his food, and Ira looked down at it.“If you’re certain you don’t want it.”Draco nodded, and Ira swiped the half-eaten sandwich.When Draco and Ira arrived back to the Plant and Potions Department, they bumped into Betty almost immediately.“Oh! Hello, Healer White and Healer Malfoy,” she greeted brightly.“Hello Betty,” said Draco.“Hi,” Ira said. “Is everything alright?”Betty nodded. “I’ve already finishing my morning rounds. Someone was just admitted though. Leo is taking care of him right now, but I thought you should know, Healer Malfoy. It was an involuntary poisoning, but the patient is stabilized.”“Good. Thank you, Betty. I’ll head on over there now. What’s the room number?”“Room fourteen,” Betty answered.“Good, let’s head over there now…”“Right, I’ll take my leave, then,” Ira said. “Goodbye Betty. And Draco, don’t be so hard on yourself.”Draco rolled his eyes and waved them away; Betty gave a cheery, “Bye!”The two of them began walking to room fourteen while Betty caught Draco up on other happenings in the Ward while he had been absent. Everyone seemed to be doing well, especially one patient who’d been bitten on the arm by a Venomous Tentacula a day before.“Thank you for handling everything so well, Betty,” Draco said to her.She flushed in response. “Thank you – erm, I mean, you’re welcome, Healer Malfoy.”Though he didn’t quite understand her nervousness around him, he much preferred it to the hatred or fear that some bore towards him.“When will your licensing exam be?”“In December, sir.”“So just a few months, then. I’m certain you’ll do brilliantly, Betty,” he smiled softly down at her.Betty flushed even deeper. “Thank you, sir. I really hope so.”They got to the new patient’s room; Draco knocked on the door and went inside, Betty at his heels. Leonel was tending to the unconscious patient who was laying weakly on the bed.“Good afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” said Leonel, glancing up briefly at him and Betty before focusing once again on the patient. “I’ve just administered a basic antidote until we figure out for sure what caused it. I also cast a stabilizing charm on him earlier so his condition doesn’t get worse.”“Great, thank you, Leo,” Draco replied.He retrieved the patient’s files from the nightstand and skimmed over them. Bill Douglas was apparently brought in by his coworker at the Ministry at 11:48 am when he’d noticed Douglas turning a slight purple color.“Interesting,” murmured Draco. He looked up at Leonel, who was now watching him. “What do they do at the Ministry?”“They’re Aurors, actually,” Leo answered. He nodded towards Betty. “That’s why we think someone intentionally poisoned him with an intent to harm, or worse.”“Right.” Draco thought for a minute. “Let’s try Indica Externa if you haven’t already, and if we can’t find out what it is with that, I’ll have one of you go to the Auror Department and find out what cases they were working on. And interview his partner again, just in case.”“Yes, Healer,” said Leonel and Betty at once.Draco spent the next half hour researching poisons in his book collection before going to Ira’s to ask about it. Indica Externa had revealed that it was an interesting combination of poisons that was causing Douglas’ condition. Ira being the innovative Potions expert that they were, Draco guessed that they would have some idea of how to counteract the effect the combination was having on the man.It was only until Leonel came back from the Auror Department with pertinent facts on a homicide case Douglas and his partner had been investigating that they put all the information together. Ira went to work immediately on brewing an antidote that would target the negative effects the poisons were having on Douglas, and Leonel and Betty would continue to monitor him until it was done.It was 4 pm by the time Draco felt confident that they were doing all they could for Douglas and that he could move on to other patients and do his rounds. He saved Potter for last – because of nerves, perhaps? Or maybe because Draco wanted to spend more time with him.Draco knocked on Potter’s door and came inside, wondering how Potter would be feeling today. He got his answer immediately.Potter was alert, wide-eyed and his forehead damp with sweat as he stared at Draco from where he stood in the center of the room.“My apologies, Potter,” Draco said as he shut the door closed, “I didn’t mean to startle you.”“It’s fine,” replied Potter quickly. “I’m just – er, particularly jumpy today.”Draco made a note of that.“Do you know why?”Potter shook his head.“I’ve had a feeling of dread ever since I woke up this morning,” Potter told him distantly, like his mind was far away. He was not looking at Draco, but instead at the bed. He wrung his hands together as he spoke. “I assume it’s just me being anxious for no reason, but it’s driving me a bit mad.”“What do you mean by ‘a feeling of dread’?” Draco asked.“Like something bad is going to happen, or did happen. Y’know when your chest is all tight and it actually hurts? Like that.”Draco nodded, knowing the feeling all too well.“And it just started this morning?” he asked, ready to write the answer down.“Sort of. It was kind of bad yesterday, but not so bad it interfered with everything. Today, though, I can’t focus on anything…” Potter trailed off.“As I’m sure you know, anxiety is a common symptom for both types of withdrawal you’re going through. Aside from giving you a Draught of Peace, the only thing to do is wait it out.”Potter gave a hollow laugh. “Brilliant.”“Your body is still weaning off of the potions, so a single dose of Draught –““No, I can’t chance it,” Potter shook his head aggressively. “I’ve been completely clean since that final step of the Cleansing thing. I can’t risk it.”“Of course,” Draco said quietly. He watched Potter pace in tight circles for a moment, then sat down in the visitor’s chair. “Why don’t you sit down, Potter?”Potter stopped and regarded Draco with wary eyes and crossed arms. He moved slowly to the side of the bed closest to Draco and sat down. From the close distance, Draco could easily see the heavy bags under Potter’s eyes.“Straighten out your back,” Draco said, and Potter obeyed. “Now inhale deeply, as long as you can. Keep the air in.”Draco watched as Potter followed his commands, his face impassive as he stared back at Draco.“Exhale slowly.”Potter did so. He sat there for a moment before saying to Draco, “It didn’t help. Maybe for a second it did, but now I just feel the same as I did before.”“You can keep repeating those motions and keep getting that good second,” replied Draco. “It will go away eventually.”Potter took his glasses off and rubbed at his eyes.“Fuck,” he mumbled.“Did you tell Healer Estrada or Trainee Healer Burke about this when they came in to check on you earlier today?”“Sort of,” Potter answered. He shoved his glasses back on and bit his lip. “Maybe not in so many words.”“You can trust them. They’re very good at their job.”“I know,” said Potter defensively. “Betty’s nice. I just don’t know the American bloke well. He…”“He what?” prodded Draco.“I don’t know anything about him. Betty’s told me about herself and she talks to me about things other than…all this,” Potter explained, gesturing vaguely around himself. “But, er, Estrada is just work-oriented. He’s sort of just mysterious.”“You can ask him,” Draco nodded. “He’ll gladly tell you about himself. Healer Estrada likes to be professional in the work setting, but he’s a really nice bloke, I promise you.”Potter quirked an eyebrow. “What, does he tell you about himself?”Draco barely managed to hold a laugh down. He’s heard Leo talk a lot about himself over the years.“Yes. He can be open; he just prefers to put his job first.”“I dunno.”“Ask him next time. Tell him you’d feel more comfortable around him if you were more familiar with him. Or I can talk to him for you.”“God, no.” Potter made a face. “Don’t do that.”“Alright, I won’t,” Draco said. “It’ll be up to you, then. I know Estrada well, and I know he’d be receptive to the idea.”‘Know him well’ was a massive understatement, but Potter didn’t need to know that.“Why weren’t you here this morning, anyway?”Draco’s heart fluttered at the thought that Potter noticed his absence.“I slept a little longer than I meant to and had a lunch with a coworker,” Draco explained. “And then a new patient came in, so I was only able to make afternoon rounds.”Potter's gaze dropped to Draco's chest momentarily; he was nearly smirking."Is that why you're not wearing robes either?"Draco looked down at himself, surprised, and realized belatedly that he indeed was not wearing his Healers robes - only the white-button up and trousers he usually wore underneath them. He'd forgotten to put them back on after returning from lunch. Why did no one else tell him?"Oh. Yes, I apologize. I didn't even realize," Draco said slowly, feeling his face heat up slightly."'S fine, Malfoy."Potter took a deep breath and closed his eyes a moment.“This is helping. Distraction.”Draco smiled and nodded slightly. “What else would you like to talk about?”Potter opened his eyes and thought for a moment. “How mental it is that Ginny and Zabini are going out.”Draco chuckled softly. Potter’s lips twitched.“I didn’t understand it at first, either, but when I see them together, it makes much more sense.”Potter looked dubious.“Blaise has thought Ginevra was fit ever since Hogwarts,” Draco revealed to Potter, who remained unphased. “Give them a chance. Next time Blaise is in town, you should try to spend time with the two of them.”“Hm,” was all Potter said.“Think about it.”

Notes:
Ooooh some development! Finally! I'm trying to get more in touch with book Ginny, real Ginny. I feel like I lose her sometimes and have to remember that she's actually a tough gal who isn't afraid to say what she thinks.Thank you for all of the nice comments, they really do make my day better PS do British people call weed "weed"? I know spliff is used instead of joint, but what about weed itself? That said, lots more drug talk in this one! Be careful my pals




Chapter Text
Last night still felt surreal for Harry. He didn't even know what he was thinking at first. He had felt strong enough to walk down the halls in his Cloak for the first time since Ginny had brought it to him. If he really wanted to leave St. Mungo’s and take a walk like he said he did, he would have to build up the strength for it, both mentally and physically.Harry was still fatigued most of the time, sometimes feeling as though he might pass out any second. The worst was when he’d get shooting pains throughout his body – starting from the back of his head and running down his neck and spine. What had started as simple headaches evolved into these debilitating pains that sometimes didn’t allow him to do anything but lie on his back and wait for them to end. He’d asked Malfoy about it yesterday morning, and he told Harry that they were called waves, which was an incredibly misleading name in Harry’s opinion.And the anxiety. His chest was so tight it hurt, and his heart was constantly pounding, loud and fast in his ears. Everything’d been making him jump lately and he’d had his first full-blown panic attack for the first time in a while yesterday.But hey, at least he wasn’t throwing up anymore.In a way, venturing out into the corridors in the dead of night was him "preparing" for the outside. That was when he saw Malfoy walking through the corridor alone. Harry's curiosity was piqued, and the rest was history.He didn’t mind talking to Malfoy when it wasn't about all the ridiculous bullshit that was going on in his life. It helped in distracting him from – everything. It was clear to Harry how much he’d grown since Harry had known him. There wasn’t much about him that was recognizable from the Malfoy at Hogwarts, and though it was still remarkably strange, Harry had halfway accepted it. Malfoy wasn’t a complete tosser anymore.And the sight of a sleep-deprived Malfoy in a tight, white button-up with the top two buttons undone was one he wouldn't be forgetting soon. It had allowed Harry a peak at Malfoy’s collarbone and the smooth skin underneath.“Is there anything else?”Startled back to the present and faced again with the now properly-buttoned Malfoy, Harry cleared his throat and told him no.He wanted it.Craved it.His hands itched for it.At this point, Harry wasn’t feeling particularly picky. Whisky, calming potions, Xanax, weed, or cocaine…anything would do. Just as long as he wasn’t sober.Just one drink, one pill, one line, and all of this would just melt away. God, his mouth watered at the thought of a nice, thick line of cocaine just sitting there, waiting for him, giving him what he needed to get through the evening and the drip that he craved so badly.A pick-me-up. That was all.Harry wiped his sweaty palms on his jeans and ran both hands through his already-mussed hair."Fuck," he muttered.It would be so goddamn easy. He could put on the Cloak and just walk out of St. Mungo's. Maybe even sneak into fucking Malfoy's office to get his wand back so he could just Apparate home. He didn't think he could walk all the way back, and he had no money on him, Muggle or Wizarding.He'd apparently left his cell phone back at his flat, which was fine. As soon as he got back home, he could text one of his plugs and pick it up or even just walk to the supermarket and buy a drink and –Pain suddenly shot down his spine, forcing him back on his bed. He groaned through gritted teeth and gripped the bed sheets tight as he rode it out.A few minutes later, the wave had passed and Harry was left panting and sweating even more than he had been before. This one had lasted longer than his previous ones, he noted, and as a result, he felt even more exhausted than usual. His heartbeat was pounding, loud and forceful throughout his entire body.He was just starting to sit up again when the door opened and Healer Estrada came in."Mr. Potter? Are you alright?" he asked, closing the door and coming to stand by the bed. "I was alerted that your heart rate had increased to 112 beats per minute."Harry was struggling to stay upright; the stabbing pains in the back of his head also made it hard to focus.He exhaled shakily. "Yeah. It was just a wave."Estrada gave him a sympathetic look. "Would you like a Pain-Reducing Potion?"Harry thought about it momentarily before nodding. What sense of pride did he even have left?"I’ll be right back, Mr. Potter," said Estrada before leaving promptly.Harry nodded once more and laid back down, the entire back of his shirt soaked in sweat. He really needed Ginny to bring him another change of clothes.Estrada was back sooner than Harry had expected with the little bottle of maroon-colored potion. Harry straightened up, leaned against the headboard, and watched as Estrada carefully unstoppered the bottle and handed it to Harry."Here you go, Mr. Potter."Harry took it from him and drank it down in one swallow. If this was the closest he could get to what he really needed – no, wanted, then he would take it.He handed the empty bottle back to Estrada, who took it from him, closed it, and put it in his pocket. Harry regarded him for a moment, and then said, "Harry's fine.""I'm sorry?" Estrada blinked innocently while he asked this, rounding out the vowels and throwing Harry off like always. Harry never really had been around Americans before.“You can call me Harry," he explained. "'Mr. Potter' is just...too much right now.""Of course, Mr. - Harry," Estrada said, a sheepish smile on his handsome face. "I apologize."Harry nearly smiled back. "It's alright.""Is there anything else I can do for you right now, Harry?"He thought about Malfoy's words. That Estrada liked to be professional, but he would open up if prompted to. Harry knew he would feel more comfortable around him if he knew something about the bloke other than the fact that he was American and unrealistically fit.Harry sat up a little straighter, feeling the pain in his body melt away by the second."Tell me something about yourself."Estrada's dark eyes widened slightly. "Um, what do you want to know?""How'd you end up here? You're from the States, aren't you?"Estrada nodded. He kept looking at Harry like he expected him to start laughing or yelling at him.“I was born in the U.S.. In the state of Colorado, to be exact. I'm a Muggleborn, so you can imagine how shocked my conservative, Catholic Mexican parents were when we found out I had magic,” Estrada grinned. “I went to Ilvermorny and decided to study medicine sometime during that. I went to a Wizarding med school in the U.S., but wanted to come to London to do my residency and actually practice. Which is...what I'm doing now.”“Wow,” Harry said for lack of a better word. He closed his eyes, trying to focus on the conversation and not his intense heartbeat. He opened them again and regarded Estrada. “How old are you?”“I'm twenty-three. You're the same age as Draco, aren't you? I know you two were in the same year at, uh, Hogwarts.”Harry was surprised by Estrada calling Malfoy by his first name. Not the Head Healer, and not even Healer Malfoy. Just 'Draco.'“Do you call all your superiors by their first names?”Estrada, flustered, ducked his head away.“No, it was...uh,” he mumbled, squinting at a spot to the right of Harry. “He just doesn't mind.”Harry's curiosity was piqued, but he decided on another avenue of attack.“Yeah, Malfoy and I are the same age. Does he talk a lot about Hogwarts?”“I have to pry it out of him,” Estrada admitted. “He hasn’t told me that much. And I’ve found out a lot of things out from articles.” At Harry’s wary look, Estrada conceded, “Which I know aren’t always factual, but it’s still something. You-Know-Who was never that big of a deal in the U.S., but we still heard about major events. Y’know, like…”It looked like Estrada suddenly realized who he was talking to again, someone who really didn’t need examples of major events during the War, for he trailed off and went silent. Harry was equal parts appreciative and annoyed. He wasn’t that fragile, and anyway, it’s not like he only thought about the war when someone brought it up. It was always in the back of his mind, even when he tried to block it out with substances.Harry’s bad mood was bubbling up within him again; he suddenly felt very irritable and back to really wanting a drink.“But um...” Estrada began again, “He’s talked about his friends…his professors. Like what I’ve told Draco about Ilvermorny.”“Sorry,” Harry interrupted, “But you know what he was like, right? Did he tell you about all the classist and prejudiced shite he spewed? Did he talk about how horrible he was to me, my friends, some of our professors? Or did he just tell you the nice bits, like how he was Prefect or got top marks in Potions?”Estrada’s entire body had tensed up and the open expression on his face had turned to one of mild fear. Harry couldn’t find it in him to feel too badly about it; in fact, he wasn’t feel much of anything at the moment.“He almost killed one of my best friends,” Harry said hollowly. He blinked, looked at Estrada, and scowled. “What am I even doing here?”“Mr. Potter, please,” Estrada finally spoke. His voice wavered slightly, but he stood his ground. “You know that he’s changed. He’s been redeeming himself for years and he’s proved himself to be a good man. He wouldn’t be a Healer otherwise. And I know how badly he feels about everything. It wrecks him. I’ve…seen it.”There was a lot that was left unspoken there, Harry knew. So much Estrada was holding back. Why did he care so much anyway? Were they best mates as well as coworkers – or rather, superior and employee?“You’ve seen it?” Harry raised his eyebrows.Estrada looked away again, avoiding Harry’s eyes. The same as before – something tugged at Harry. What was it?“I just know him, Mr. Potter,” he said softly. “He’s changed in the nearly two years I’ve known him. He cares about his patients, about his friends, his family. He’s become so much more compassionate; Draco’s always been an amazing Healer, but now he’s even better because he puts everything into helping his patients. Including you.”Something about the sincerity in Estrada’s voice stopped Harry from arguing even more. The anger was slowly draining from his body and mind, and soon all that was left was the sickening pounding of his heart and the trembling in his hands.Harry took off his glasses to rub at his eyes. He dragged his hands roughly down his whole face and knelt forward, still covering his face with his hands. Why did he suddenly feel like crying? Why had he been so angry just a moment before? Even Harry himself couldn’t keep up with his mood swings. He felt like he didn’t have control over himself – he was just watching as his body said or did things, detached from himself entirely.He heard the scratch of the chair’s metal legs on the tile floor and looked up, disoriented. Estrada had stood up and was regarding Harry with a sad frown.“Why don’t I leave, Mr. Potter,” Estrada suggested with a quiet voice, “So you can get some rest?”Harry nodded slowly, feeling incredibly drained.“I’m sorry,” Harry said feebly. “I don’t know why – I just get so angry sometimes.”“It’s alright,” Estrada replied. “I know it’s a part of healing, and I shouldn’t have argued with you-““No, you were right. I know he’s changed,” Harry said truthfully. “But then I think about everything he’s said and done and I just – it’s a bit confusing going from thinking you know someone to realizing you don’t know them at all, and you haven’t for years.”"I think you might want to keep an open mind. That’s all I can suggest.”It was around 5 pm the next day when Harry decided he would venture out into the corridors again. With the Invisibility Cloak, of course. It would be busy enough that Harry would be able to walk among other people again, but not so busy that he'd have a panic attack in the middle of it.Taking several deep breaths, Harry drew the Cloak over himself. He ensured he was fully covered before opening the door a crack. He peeked outside and saw a rather slow flow of human traffic in the corridor. Still, there were people talking and laughing and existing out there, and enough so that Harry's palms started to get damp.Wiping them impatiently on his trousers, Harry left the safety of his room and closed the door shut, hearing the tiny click as he did so.He was outside his room during the day. The only other time he'd done that was going to and from Malfoy's office under a Disillusionment Spell, and under the protection of Malfoy.He was on his own now.Harry watched as two women walked past him, voices low in serious conversation. He heard someone - a child, probably - crying down the hall. He saw a Mediwitch walk past speaking quickly to that Healer Harry had seen once or twice – the tall one with the white-blond hair that rivaled Malfoy's own.Speak of the devil, Harry thought, as his eyes landed on Malfoy, who was stood talking to Estrada in front of his office.His curiosity getting the better of him, Harry began moving closer to the two men until he was only about a meter away from them. From this distance, he could hear what they were saying while avoiding the risk of being caught."...was really upset," Estrada was murmuring, his dark brows pulled together."It's the nature of his recovery," Malfoy responded, "And his illness. And his being, if I'm being completely honest."Estrada glared a bit at Malfoy, albeit playfully."Don't say that, Draco. He's still your patient.""I know that, Leo. And either way, it’s true."Leo?  What was going on? They were talking about him, that was clear enough, but the way Malfoy was making quips around his junior, and the way Estrada had responded with comfortable familiarity right away...it was strange."Although I guess I shouldn't talk," Estrada was saying, "Since I think I got him even more riled up."Malfoy let out a short laugh. No menace, no cruelty - just light-hearted amusement."I don't think so. Potter can rile himself up with little to no difficulty. But thank you, I suppose, for defending my honor."Estrada grinned then; a grin that Harry had never seen on Estrada’s face before. It was...predatory, almost."Of course. It was my pleasure."Something within Harry, something he hadn't felt in years, was rousing deep in his stomach."Leo..."Harry had never heard Malfoy's voice be so soft, or so vulnerable. The expression on his face amplified it – a hint of a smile playing on his lips, eyebrows slightly raised as if happily surprised and up for a challenge."You know I don't –“Estrada's hand had somehow found its way to one of the edges of Malfoy's robes and was now fingering the cloth covertly. Harry saw rather than heard Malfoy's light gasp."Me neither," Estrada cut in, his hand climbing up Malfoy's torso and settling at his chest. Malfoy's neck had started to become flushed as he glanced down at Estrada's hand and back up to his face. "But that doesn’t mean we can’t fuck anymore."The sound of blood rushed loudly and violently through Harry's ears, and he was suddenly filled with the overwhelming urge to punch Estrada in his stupid, grinning face. He was one second from grabbing him by the collar of his shirt and getting him as far away from Malfoy as possible.Harry clenched his fists so tightly that his fingernails dug into his flesh. Malfoy took Estrada's hand in his own and said in a low voice, "Leo."He couldn't watch anymore.Harry backed away and turned on his heel, nearly barreling back into his room, back into safety.As soon as he had slammed the door shut, he ripped the Cloak off and began pacing around the room. His thudding heartbeat vibrated throughout his entire body, his blood boiling and mind racing.
But that doesn’t mean we can’t fuck anymore.
Of course. Of course, it was so bloody obvious now, looking back at it.Malfoy and Estrada. Estrada and Malfoy. All the unspoken words, how Estrada had looked away whenever Harry asked too much about Malfoy, the way they both had said they knew each other “well.”Harry scoffed loudly, both at them and his own idiocy.Fuck, he would really like a drink now. Calming, whisky, vodka, dreamless sleep – whatever – as long as it would help him (not) deal with this.Could he really escape? The only real belongings he had here were the clothes on his back, the one change of clothes that Ginny had brought him a few days ago, and his Cloak. And his wand, but he could worry about that later. Right now, he just had to leave.No, that was mental. He knew that. How would he even get home? He wasn’t even sure how he’d gotten to St. Mungo’s in the first place. He had no memory of that night, and it wasn’t uncommon. Blacking out was easy when you mixed benzos and alcohol, which Harry had learned for the first time over a year ago.He certainly wasn’t strong enough to walk all the way back to his flat. He didn’t have his wand, and he didn’t have any money. He was totally and unequivocally stuck. The panic was really starting to set in now; Harry cursed aloud. If only he’d brought his mobile. Then he could reach out to someone, anyone…Was Ginny due for a visit today? Or Hermione or Ron? Would any of them let Harry leave earlier than he had planned? Would they trust him enough to not relapse immediately, especially in the state he was in? It was doubtful; none of them were complete idiots and Harry had fooled them for too long now and far too many times.He was trying to think of a half-decent excuse to leave when there was a sharp knock at the door. Harry froze where he stood, envisioning Malfoy and Estrada traipsing in while Harry was mid-panic attack.Harry almost melted from relief when the door opened and revealed Betty with a tray of food.“Mr. Potter, I’ve brought you your dinner,” she was saying happily until she caught the look on Harry’s face. The girl was really an open book, Harry noted distractedly, seeing her concern clear as day as she put the tray down on his nightstand and hurriedly walked over to him. “Are you alright? What’s happened?”“I need to –,” his voice came out wobbly. He cleared his throat and continued – the last thing he needed was to cry in front of a Trainee Healer. “I need to talk to Ginny.”“Oh, yes, of course,” Betty’s voice was high. “I’ll firecall her immediately.”“Thanks, Betty,” he managed to say before she hurried back out.It was a sign of Ginny’s dedication to Harry that she had dropped everything and arrived at St. Mungo’s at a moment’s notice just because Harry had needed her. She was in his hospital room only two minutes later, breathless as she rushed inside, her red hair flying behind her.“Harry?” she took his hands in her own. “What is it?”He looked at her through teary eyes and found he couldn’t speak.“Harry? Come on, let’s sit down.”She led him to his bed and sat themselves down, all without letting go of his hand.“It’s alright, Harry,” Ginny said in a soothing voice. “Tell me what’s wrong. We can talk through it together.”Where would he even begin? How he wanted to relapse? How he’d been feeling a sense of doom for the past four days? How his heart was simultaneously heavy and pounding so loudly, so relentlessly, that Harry found it hard to focus? How he heard Malfoy and another Healer talk about fucking at their workplace? How that made Harry have a minor panic attack?  "I want to drink," he whispered to Ginny, his voice trembling unsteadily, "So bad, Gin.""I know, Harry," she said, rubbing his back with a hand. "But it'll pass."Tears formed and fell down his face now, and Harry couldn't hold it back anymore. He let out a shuddering breath and his entire body shook with the force of his crying. Ginny kept rubbing his back and staying things like "it's alright" and "let it out."He felt so pathetic. He was just a sad excuse of a person, unable to function without the help of a few substances. He didn't know how people did it without them.Ginny pressed a kiss to his temple. She smoothed his hair down and gripped his hand tighter."You're alright, Harry. I'm here.""I'm sorry," he rasped, "I'm so sorry.""Don't be sorry.""You shouldn't have to do this. You should be with Zabini, and I should be a normal person.""Don't say that, Harry. You are."Harry let out a short, incredulous laugh. He wiped his eyes and looked at her."Right, cos all normal people break down every few days just because they have to stay sober."Ginny shrugged. "Everyone's got their thing."In spite of himself, Harry managed a laugh, a real one."Well, my thing is rubbish. I'd rather have a quirky yet endearing habit.""You have a few already, don't worry."Harry nudged her shoulder with his own. She grinned, but it fell the longer she looked at him."Are you sure there's nothing else bothering you, Harry? What made you want to drink in the first place?""I've already got a Mind Healer, thanks.""I'm your new, free, but less experienced Mind Healer," she told him seriously. "So tell me."Should he? Harry hadn't even begun to wrap his head around it himself, and he wasn't sure if he could manage to talk about it without making something explode."I went out in the corridor and heard Malfoy and Estrada talking.""Oh, the fit Hispanic one, right?"Harry nodded, gritting his teeth."Yeah, that one. Anyway, they were talking when...Estrada came onto Malfoy.""What?" Ginny asked in a hushed whisper."He said...but that doesn’t mean we can’t fuck anymore," Harry repeated it word-for-word. The sentence seemed to be ingrained in his brain."Bloody hell," Ginny said, her eyes widening. "So they've already...had at it, then?""I reckon so.""Well, that's unexpected. But what's this have to -"Ginny stopped short, and he knew it must have been written all over his face."Harry, you -" she stopped again. She stared at him. "So you really do have feelings for Malfoy?"Instead of answering, Harry knelt forward, elbows on his knees and hands covering his face."Really?"He lifted his head and met her gaze."You think I'd play a practical joke on you now?"She was frowning down at him."Sorry, Harry, but that stupid git should be the last thing on your mind right now. You've got much more important things to focus on, like getting better.""You think I don't know that?" Harry asked impatiently. "I didn't even realize until Estrada said…that, and I got...jealous. Like at a jealous-of-Dean-snogging-you level."Ginny was staring at him."Oh, Harry," she finally sighed and frowned. "I hope you know you're being an idiot. When you brought him up before, I thought you just thought he was fit, not that you wanted to be snogging him exclusively.""Yeah, me too. And I'm well aware, thanks."She mused at him."I bet you wish you'd stayed with me now. Cos if you had, your life would be so much easier."Harry rolled his eyes. "I dunno about that.""Oh please," she said as if it was obvious. "I'd be the perfect girlfriend. And you wouldn't be competing against someone who could be a bloody model."Harry gritted his teeth at the mention of Estrada. He'd like the bloke fine before he learned that he'd shagged Malfoy. And it was true - what was he compared to Estrada? Malfoy probably thought Harry pathetic and decidedly unattractive.Ginny interrupted his brooding."So what are you going to do about it?""What do you mean, what am I going to do? Nothing. That's what. The prat's still my Healer, so I'll just have to ignore him until I can leave.""And are you talking about Malfoy or Estrada right now?""Malfoy," Harry answered. He paused, then said, "But I reckon it can apply to Estrada as well.""That's a brilliant idea. Ignore the Healers who are in charge of you."Time to bite the bullet."Do you think you could help me get discharged early? I don't -""No."Harry was taken aback by her immediacy and bluntness. He hadn't even finished what he was saying, but Ginny had already crossed her arms."I'm going to get released on Monday anyway. It's only a couple of days. Come on, Gin, what difference would it make?""I'm not going to let you ruin it," Ginny told him firmly. "Not again. I love you, Harry, and I know you. I know that you wouldn't be able to stay clean if you went home today."Stung, Harry began to argue back."No I wouldn't," he said defensively, glaring at her."We both know you would," Ginny said matter-of-factly. She glared right back at him. "I'm not stupid, Harry, and you aren't either. But this is a stupid idea.""Gin-""I'll call Hermione over here," she threatened, "And Merlin bless her, she'll chain you to the bed if it came to it."Harry could only seethe at Ginny.It was true. Hermione was still upset about his escapades featuring illegal Muggle drugs and he had no doubt she would strong-arm him into staying. And he didn't want to disappoint her for the thousandth time. He sighed in exasperation, knowing the battle was already lost."Why can't I ever get angry at you?" Harry asked Ginny, who shrugged. "Fine. Whatever. I'll stay here. Just don't call Hermione over. She's upset with me as it is.""She's just worried about you.""But also angry. You and Ron can't really understand, but Hermione does.""Explain so I can understand then."Harry exhaled slowly. He closed his eyes, trying to find the words."One of the drugs, cocaine, is more of a 'hard drug.' Some are just more recreational, casual...no one has ever overdosed on them. But these harder ones can be dangerous. And I knew it, but I didn't care. It was part of the thrill. You take it, and suddenly you're more alive. Confident. You're untouchable. But then you keep using more and more and soon your heart is pounding in your ears so loud it's sickening and you wonder if it's ever going to stop or if you'll just die of a heart attack then and there."He opened his eyes and took a deep breath. Just thinking of it – envisioning cutting careful lines and putting his nose to the table – made him yearn for it.He glanced over at Ginny, whose face was unreadable."What's the point of it all?" she asked after a tense silence."To feel...anything. Alive. Scared. Something that's not just complete numbness. Ginny," he said, his heart weighed down, "I can't shake it. The war. It's always with me, and I can tell...there's something wrong with me. Deep down. And it can't be fixed.""Harry...""I might've come back wrong," he nearly whispered. "But…I think, at least if I did, there'd at least be a reason for all of this. Not being made for the living world."Ginny grabbed his face a touch too forcefully than he would've liked and made him look at her. Her eyes were harsh and cold."I'd slap you, Harry, but I won't," Ginny said coolly. "You didn't come back wrong, and you sure as hell aren't meant to be dead. You came back for a reason, and whatever it is, you're here. You're living and breathing and with all of us and you're fucking meant to be alive."Harry nodded, breathless. Ginny released him and stood suddenly.  "We all love you, Harry. Remember that," she said, her voice calmer now. She stared down at him with stern eyes. "When we thought you were dead, that you were killed by Him, I couldn't even think. I couldn't do anything. That was the first and only time in my life that I'd been so shaken I couldn't even move. I didn't know what I was supposed to do without you. Forget about the world and Voldemort, what about me? What was I meant to do?"Her voice was thick, but there were no tears. Ginny was still a woman who was rarely weepy, and yet, Harry had seen her cry twice in the past week. Because of him.“So shut up,” Ginny finished harshly, her arms crossed against her chest defensively, “And get better. Because we all need you. The real you.”But who was the “real him”? Harry didn’t even know who he was without the drugs anymore. It’s been part of his life for so long that he’d forgotten what it was like to just be Harry, and not Harry the fuck-up.He swallowed, his throat tight, and nodded.What else could he do?

Chapter Text
"But that doesn't mean we can't fuck anymore."Draco's breath caught in his throat. He felt himself flush and swallowed thickly, bringing his hand up to take hold of Leo’s own."Leo..." he whispered. "Not...here."Leo released him obediently, and Draco let out a shuddering breath. His neck was still burning."What were you thinking?" Draco hissed at him, though not angrily.Leo frowned. "Sorry, Draco. I just - I think I'm over you, but it's obvious that I'm not and…I don't know what I'm doing. You’re just so…"Draco looked at him. He couldn't find it in himself to be that mad. He sighed."My feelings are rather muddled, too. But there's still a time and place."Leo ducked his head. "Sorry."Draco straightened his robes and put a hand on Leo's shoulder briefly, causing him to look up again."It's alright, Leo. Just...don’t do it again."Leo nodded, gave him a sad smile, and walked away.Did Draco make the right decision by turning Leo down?Leo was right, wasn't he? Just because they weren't dating didn't mean they couldn't fuck. People did it all the time - casual sex, no strings attached.But Draco needed the strings. He needed the connection, the monogamy, the dedication. He knew for a fact that he didn't have feelings for Leo anymore. He had long-ago accepted why they'd broken up in the first place. He shouldn't go back. He couldn't. It wouldn't be good for either of them.He took a deep, fortifying breath. He wouldn’t.“Are you alright, Potter?”Draco didn’t know what he’d done. Potter was obviously acting more coldly toward him, but Draco didn’t know why. Even when Potter was doing poorly, he’d still talk to him. Perhaps a bit more shortly, but he still spoke.But now, Potter wouldn’t say a word to him. He would barely even look at him.“Have I done something wrong?” Draco asked.Potter’s mouth twitched, but he still said nothing.“I apologize if I did do something, but as your Healer –““It’s nothing, Malfoy,” said Potter suddenly. He glanced at Draco out of the corner of his eye. “Just drop it.”Draco watched Potter warily, disliking the way he was acting. They’d been doing well the past few days. Really well, in fact. It almost seemed like Potter enjoyed his company, and Draco would easily admit that he enjoyed his time spent with Potter. He’d thought that they had been getting along better than ever, and now their progress had seemingly been undone. What had happened in the last day?“Potter, if you don’t talk to me, I can’t help you,” Draco said in a quiet voice.Potter looked at him – for real this time. His expression was serious.“I thought that was Wolff’s job.”Draco frowned. “It’s part of mine, too.”He watched as Potter looked away again and dropped his gaze to his lap, and Draco felt lost.“Well, I – just – it’s fine, alright, Malfoy?” Potter mumbled at his hands. “I just want to finish this and get out of here.”Draco tried to swallow but the lump in his throat didn’t allow it.“Yes. Of course.” Draco spent the rest of the day wondering what he could have done to upset Potter so much, which might have been fine if actual lives weren’t depending on him. Even as he looked at other patients and consulted with Leo and Betty, some part of him was going mad trying to think what he might’ve done to wrong Potter.But maybe Draco was looking at it all wrong. Maybe Draco had nothing to do with Potter’s change in mood. He was a recovering addict, after all. There were plenty of things happening in Potter’s life right now – there was certainly no shortage of stress factors. Maybe it was, in fact, conceited of Draco to think that it was his fault, his doing.This made Draco feel a bit better, but not entirely. Potter acted the same the next day. After an uncomfortable check-up wherein Potter barely looked or talked to him, Draco enlisted the help of Betty. He found her in the employee lounge with Leo (he felt very proud sometimes, seeing them get along so well and spending so much time together) and sat down at the table across from them.“Hey boss,” greeted Leo with a grin.“Good afternoon, Healer Malfoy,” said Betty, straightening up as she always did in his presence.“Leo, Betty.”Draco was nearly always amused by the contrast between the two of them – Betty with her soft voice and posh English accent, and Leo with his warm, open voice and unabashedly American accent. How Leonel seemed to grow bolder in Draco’s presence, and Betty more timid. Their only real similarities were their ink black hair and the passion they had for their work.  “I’m assuming you’ve finished all your rounds?”He could tell Leo was trying not to roll his eyes.“Of course,” Leonel said. “All the patients are doing fine. Not too many today. And anyway, I was actually about to leave – unless there’s anything else you need me to do?”Draco shook his head. “You’re all set. Thank you, Leo.”Draco and Betty watched as Leo gathered his things and put on his travelling cloak. He waved them goodbye and went out the door, leaving the two of them alone. Draco turned to Betty and clasped his hands together. He began without preamble.“Betty, I wanted to ask about Potter. Has he been acting differently recently?”She looked thoughtful as she twirled her long braid around her fingers distractedly. Betty frowned.“I suppose he might be. But what do you mean by different?”“He hasn’t been as talkative,” Draco said. “He’s become closed off again, similar to how he was in the beginning. Just the day before yesterday we were having conversations, but now…”He trailed off, unsure of how to explain it. Betty let go of the braid and it swung away, returning to its place behind her back. She chewed on her bottom lip nervously.“Mr. Potter did seem upset yesterday. Really upset,” Betty admitted slowly. “But he only let me talk to him about his physical symptoms. When I asked him what was wrong, he just brushed me off.”“He didn’t say anything that might point to the reasoning behind the sudden change in mood?”Betty shook her head.“No, Healer Malfoy. Sorry.”Draco sighed. “It’s not your fault, Betty.”His saving grace had come a few hours later when he saw Ginevra leaving Potter’s room.Draco had nearly raced to catch up with her and he’d ended up having to call her name out down the corridor. She stopped at the sound of her name, her head snapping round to identify the source of the sound. When she saw him, she turned around completely, crossing her arms as Draco approached her. He ushered her over to a more secluded spot, and she looked at him expectantly.“Yes, Malfoy?”He got flashbacks to fifth year when she’d preformed that horrible Bat Bogey Hex on him. Draco cleared his throat.“Sorry – I was just hoping to talk to you. About Potter,” he added at her raised eyebrows.“Oh,” Ginevra said. She shifted her weight onto her other foot. “What about him?”“He’s been acting strangely these past few days, and I don’t know what’s caused it. When I ask him about it, he dismisses it and says that everything is fine when it’s clearly not,” Draco told her. “It’s just – a bit worrying that his mood has shifted so suddenly and so close to his scheduled release, and even worse that he hasn’t told me what’s caused it.”The look on Ginevra’s face was inscrutable.“He’s got his Mind Healer, doesn’t he?”Draco almost laughed at that – he never realized that Ginevra and Potter were on such similar trains of thought. Maybe that’s why they had dated for however many years it was.“Yes,” said Draco slowly, “But he won’t be able to speak with her until Monday. I admit I’m rather…concerned for Potter. I don’t want whatever’s happened to derail his recovery.”“It won’t,” she said immediately, her tone suddenly defensive. She sighed and ran a hand through her long hair. “Look, Malfoy, I know what’s upsetting him, but it won’t get in the way of him getting better. I’ll make damn sure of that.”“Much easier said than done.”“I know that,” she snapped harshly – on the defensive again. “You think I don’t? I mean it, though. I’ll chain myself to him if it means it’ll stop him from using.”Draco felt his neck warm at that, an unwitting image of Ginevra placing Potter in handcuffs floating into his head. What in the bloody hell was wrong with him?“I’m assuming you won’t tell me what’s upsetting him,” Draco said, trying to push the inappropriate thought away.“You assume correctly,” said Ginevra. “It’s not my place to tell you.”“Does it have something to do with me?”She looked surprised at that but collected herself quickly. “Still not my place to tell you. If you want to know so badly, why don’t you just ask Harry?”“I believe I’ve already told you that he won’t tell me,” Draco said, his patience running out, “And that’s why I’ve come to you.”“Try again, then,” she rolled her eyes. “You were never one to give up easy, Malfoy. But even if he doesn’t, it’s only two days ‘til Monday. He can talk about it then to his Mind Healer.”“And only two days until he’s released.”Ginevra faltered. Not so confident in him staying now, was she? Draco said nothing and waited.And then she broke. “Fine. Just – keep asking him, alright? If you keep pushing he’ll tell you. He’s never been able to control his temper; he’s bound to break eventually.”She was frowning, and Draco nodded.“Thank you.”“Be easy on him,” she said softly. Her eyes searched him – for what? “Bye, Malfoy.”“Potter, just tell me what I’ve done wrong!” Draco burst out, his voice loud and bordering on desperation. “We’d been getting on fine before you suddenly started giving me the cold shoulder. I am your Healer and am useless to you if you won’t talk me, so stop being a coward and tell me what’s happened!”Potter’s eyes flashed dangerously. Draco knew he had taken a gamble in calling Potter a coward, but Ginevra had told him to keep pushing him until he broke. Potter took a shaky breath and then, as Draco watched with his heart in his throat, he stood and took two steps towards Draco, who had to force himself not to back away. Standing his ground, he met Potter’s gaze and held it.“You’re really calling me a coward?” Potter yelled back. Draco flinched infinitesimally. “That’s rich, considering it’s coming from Draco bloody Malfoy!”“If you’re so brave, tell me what’s happened for you to stop talking to me completely!”“You want to know, Malfoy? You really want to?”“Obviously!”They were both breathing hard with their eyes trained on each other. Potter seemed to be considering something, deciding if he should say whatever he wanted to.“I heard you talking to Estrada out in the corridor, heard him talking about fucking you,” Potter said harshly as if the word left a bad taste in his mouth.Potter was gritting his teeth and avoiding Draco’s gaze. Draco was taken aback – out of everything he had guessed, this was not one of them. Shock quickly turned to confusion.“What – I’m sorry if we acted inappropriately at work, I told him off afterwards –““No, it’s not that, you prat,” Potter rolled his eyes aggressively and finally met Draco’s gaze once more.“Then what? Are you a prude? Homophobic?”Potter looked two seconds away from pulling his hair out, and it was exactly how Draco had felt on the inside.“Jesus Christ, Malfoy, I thought you were meant to be clever,” he nearly growled.Draco felt his cheeks flush at that, but he truly didn’t know why that exchange could have made Potter so angry.“Spell it out for me if I’m that thick, then!”“I was jealous!” Potter roared at him. His eyes were wild behind the glasses. “Happy, Malfoy? Is that what you wanted to hear?”Draco was lost for words. His mouth worked uselessly before he snapped it shut. Potter had spun around and began pacing impatiently.Draco watched him, perplexed. His mind was racing. Jealous? Draco never would have guessed. He didn’t even know that Potter liked blokes. And jealous of who? Him…or Estrada?“I – of who?” Draco asked finally, his tongue twisting stupidly on the words.Potter let out a bitter laugh without turning back around. Draco watched the back of his head with a clenched chest.“Him, Malfoy,” he answered lowly. “I’m jealous of him.”Draco was almost glad that Potter’s back was turned on him, for he was certain he looked like a complete fool with his mouth hanging open.His head spun.Potter…fancied him? Harry Potter? Fallen hero-turned-addict? The one person he was enamored by during Hogwarts, and the last person he should be fancying now?He wanted to run. That was Draco’s first instinct. Run like a bloody coward – Potter was right about that – in that moment, that’s all Draco wanted to do. It was almost like Potter had sensed it, for he took this moment to turn back round. He crossed his arms tightly and looked at Draco, a bitter smile on his face.“Still glad you asked? Now you know some junkie loser fancies you and –““You’re not a –“ Draco began through fritted teeth.“- you’ve got to keep treating him, the freak.”“Stop it,” Draco snapped. “I never said – or thought – any of that.”If Potter could cross his arms any tighter, Draco would have been concerned for his blood circulation.“Really?” Potter asked flatly, disbelievingly.“Really, you git.”“So what is it, then? Pity?”“No,” growled Draco. “Merlin, Potter, I never would have thought you’d be so self-deprecating. Where’s the Harry Potter who walked around Hogwarts like he owned the place?”Potter gave a disbelieving chuckle and walked away again.Draco’s mind was still racing – what was he supposed to do? When in all his studies had he learned what to do if your patient fancied you? Pushing away all the personal thoughts that were flying around in his head, he focused on the professional.“Potter, you don't –“ Draco stopped, then started again in a calmer voice. “You're in recovery. Your brain is getting used to almost everything again, and I understand that it is overwhelming, and feelings and thoughts will get jumbled, and there's a good reason recovering addicts are strongly discouraged from starting new relationships.”Potter was gritting his teeth so hard Draco was surprised he couldn't hear them grind against each other.“I know what I'm feeling.”“You may think you do, but you've just spent the past few years in a haze. It's going to take longer than a week and a half to become adjusted to reality again and to figure out what you want.”“Shut up, Malfoy!” Potter snapped. “Don't fucking patronize me.”“I'm not, I'm simply –“Potter advanced on Draco, stopping until his nose was only a few centimeters away from Draco's own.“You know I feel, Malfoy? I feel clear-headed for the first time in years. You're right. I was in a haze. That's why I know what I want so clearly.”“Potter, -“ he began again.“No, fuck you, Malfoy,” Potter growled. He backed up and stalked away, facing the window with his arms crossed. “Get out.”Draco left.“Ira,” Draco was saying before he had even fully opened the door to their office. “You’re attractive and charming, right?”Ira was sat at their desk, legs stretched out and feet propped up on it. There was a book in their lap and they looked up from it as Draco came in and began to pace nervously. Ira blinked once and raised an eyebrow, a smirk growing on their face.“I’d like to think so, yes.”Draco stopped and faced them. “What do you do when a patient fancies you?”This was apparently not what Ira had expected, because the smirk on their face fell. They took their long legs off the desk and looked at Draco curiously.“Well, I’ve only had theories, of course, never explicit declarations of love,” Ira said thoughtfully. “So I suppose I never had to do anything.”“Alright then, what would you do?”“Let them down gently,” said Ira seriously. “I’m too busy for a relationship. And anyway, it’s inapp-“ Ira stopped mid-word and their pale eyes widened. “Draco, is this…are you talking about Mr. Potter?”“The one and only,” Draco said bitterly, and finally sat down in the chair across from Ira. He slumped in his seat and pressed a hand to his face. “What the fuck am I meant to do, Ira?”And for once, Ira seemed at a loss for words. Several moments passed before Ira stood and opened up a cabinet door. Draco watched as Ira pulled out a half-empty bottle of Crown Royal and set it down on their desk with a clunk. Ira fished out two glasses and set them down too.“No ice, I’m afraid,” Ira said as they took a seat once more. “Though it’s often cold enough in here where I don’t think it’s all that necessary.”Draco was gobsmacked as Ira poured generous servings of Scotch into the two glasses.“Do you really drink that?” he asked, looking down at the glass Ira had pushed him with distaste.“I think you meant to say thank you Ira,” Ira said, and lifted their own glass. “Cheers.”Draco half-heartedly raised his own and drank what must have been at least equal to a shot. He shuddered and coughed weakly. The rest of the Scotch seemed to be taunting him.“Bloody disgusting,” Draco said, wishing for the taste to leave his mouth.“Bloody delicious,” Ira corrected him again. They raised their wand and sent a locking charm at the door before returning their attention back to Draco. “Alright. Let’s talk this through.”

It's suddenly occurred to me that many fic writers keep to a regular posting schedule and now I feel bad about posting so infrequently and sporadically. Not saying I'm going to change anything, but I want to say thank you thank you thank you for still reading after all this time. I really don't deserve it.




Chapter Text
Johnny was waving a baggie in Harry's face. The white powder inside was tantalizing, and Harry smiled."Oh, thank fuck," he sighed in relief.Harry was sat on Johnny's couch, having been waiting for him to return from his dealer. Johnny had just come back a few moments earlier, shrugging off his heavy jacket and joining Harry on the couch.Johnny let out a breathless laugh as he set to work, tipping a small amount of the powder onto his coffee table. He swiped his ID from the corner of the table and began cutting it into neat lines."Good?" Johnny asked.Harry nodded.Johnny tightly rolled a five-pound note and bent over the table. Harry watched as he snorted one of the four lines quickly, straightening his back and tilting his head up.Without a word, Johnny passed the note to Harry, still sniffling and staring at the ceiling. Harry's brain was already buzzing with excitement as he knelt over the table –He woke up.Harry blinked, remembered where he was, and groaned. He was fucking dreaming about drugs now, and if that wasn't a sign of how pathetic he'd become, he didn't know what was. It had seemed so real and the want was overwhelming for Harry, manifesting in his chest and teasing him with something he couldn't have, something he so desperately wanted.Harry turned in bed, switching to his other side, and tried to go back to sleep. He knew from the moment he'd opened his eyes, however, that he wouldn't be able to sleep again that morning. Regardless, he lay there for ten minutes with his eyes closed, his mind jumping from thought to thought, one remaining dominant.God, he had really fucking yelled at Malfoy about how he fancied him.In terms of low points in his life, Harry thought he had to rate that one in the top five. Harry still remembered with a gut-wrenching clarity the way Malfoy had looked at him after his outburst. The shock on his face said it all, and as if it couldn’t get worse, Malfoy had dismissed his feelings entirely. He could only imagine what Malfoy was thinking. Was he repulsed? Or did he find it hilarious?He felt pathetic. Harry groaned aloud, wishing he could Obliviate himself and rid himself of the memory.It was Saturday. He was going to be released the day after tomorrow, even though he felt so unbelievably far from ready. The only thing that gave him the semblance of hope was that Ginny was going to be with him and making sure he wouldn't relapse. It made him nervous, funnily enough, to think about living with Ginny again. It'd been years since they had before she'd broken up with him and moved out, leaving Harry to his own devices.That was the first time he'd been really alone in his life. Even with the Dursleys, he'd been isolated emotionally, yes, but there were still always three pairs of eyes on him. He'd gone straight from there to Hogwarts to being on the run with Hermione and Ron to moving into a flat with Ginny. And then she'd left him.Not that he blamed her at all. No, he knew he was a rubbish boyfriend. What with the insomnia and panic attacks and dreamless sleep and alcohol, he was a nightmare to live with. He absolutely commended her for sticking with him for so long. He hoped he wouldn't drive her away this time, too.His miserable thoughts were interrupted by a low, quick knock and Betty entering the room. Harry had expected her; he'd become quite good at discerning whose knocks were whose, as sad as it was."Good morning, Mr. Potter," she gave him a small, nervous smile as she carried over the tray of breakfast.Harry attempted a smile and sat upright, leaning against the headboard. He'd tried many times before to get her to call him Harry, but she politely refused."Morning, Betty.""How are you feeling today?"She proceeded to perform diagnostic spells and wrote the results on his chart at the foot of his bed. Harry shrugged in place of a real answer. He wasn't sure if she saw him."Your vitals are excellent," Betty remarked as she let the clipboard swing back down and walked closer to him. She hugged her arms to her chest. "Mr. Potter? How are you?""Not," he said haltingly, "Too great.""Would you like to talk about it?""Not really," Harry admitted.He hoped Hermione and Ron would come and visit today. It'd been a few days since their last visit, and he thought it likely since it was the weekend. He could talk to them. Hermione would provide him with logic and Ron blunt friendship.Betty seemed to read his mind, and asked, "Would you be able to talk about it with your friends, if not with me?"Harry bit his lip and nodded.Betty gave him a sympathetic smile and nodded as well. "Alright. Is there anything else I can do for you?""No," Harry sighed. "Thank you, Betty." Harry's wish was granted when Hermione and Ron arrived half past ten."Hey, mate," said Ron, coming forward and sitting down in a chair. "How've you been?"Hermione gave him a one-armed hug and sat down as well. "We're so sorry we haven't been able to visit, Harry."Harry waved the apology away. "It's fine. You two have got jobs and actual lives -"Hermione gave him a look that made him fall silent. He cleared his throat and decided to answer Ron's question instead.“I'm, er...well. I've got to tell you something.”At their alarmed looks, Harry quickly added, "It's not bad. Well, it is, but in a different way.” He sighed and continued, wishing they'd stop looking at him like that. “Look, I think I...fancy Malfoy, as mental as it is, and I only figured it out because I overheard him talking to the American Healer and it sounds like they were together –““What, that bloke's bent too?"Ron sounded relieved for whatever reason; Hermione swatted Ron's arm and glared at him pointedly.Harry rolled his eyes impatiently and continued speaking, "- and I got jealous and so, y'know, I stopped talking to him and Malfoy just snapped and kept being a complete git until I just told him. That I think I fancy him, and he just acted - strange and tried to Healer his way out of it but that was yesterday and I haven't seen or talked to him since."Harry took a deep breath and watched Ron and Hermione's faces, waiting for them to say something. Ron's face was pale and he looked uncomfortable; Hermione was pursing her lips and studying Harry right back.“Harry, mate...” Ron finally said weakly, “When will this obsession with Malfoy end?”Affronted and slightly hurt, Harry sputtered, “Obsession? What – “But Ron just gave him a look and Harry shut up. Hermione sighed and put a hand on his arm.“Oh, Harry. You should try to focus on recovery. That's the most important thing for you right now, and nothing should jeopardize you getting better. Especially when you're so close to getting released. Maybe...maybe you're having these feelings for Draco because you're around him so much, he's been helping you and guiding you and you've sort of latched onto him...? He is the person you've been seeing and talking to the most recently."Harry gritted his teeth. So Hermione would try to pass it off as him not being clear-headed as well?"It makes sense that you've formed an attachment to him.""What, like Stockholm Syndrome?""No," Hermione bit her lip and her brows drew close. "Well, perhaps a bit. But not at all.""I know what I'm feeling, Hermione," Harry said lowly.She was giving him the look he'd gotten used to over the years, the one that said, 'oh, Harry' in a patronizing way. He looked away so as to not glare at her."Just because you're feeling this…attraction right now doesn't mean it's real. You've been through so much these past two weeks. You need your rest, Harry, and to focus on -""On recovery, yeah. God, you sound just like Malfoy," Harry scowled, "I get it.""Do you?" Hermione challenged.Before Harry could do more than turn and glare at Hermione, Ron interrupted."Ginny's told us that she's planning on staying with you for a bit," he said, clearing his throat. He was eyeing Harry seriously, as if daring Harry to say something rude to his fiancée. "Help you get settled."Harry nodded slowly."Good," Ron said, giving a tense nod of his own.They stared at each other for a bit, and Harry wondered for the thousandth time how they had ended up here.Harry took his glasses off and rubbed his eyes."What about you lot? How've you been?" he asked warily as he shoved his glasses back on.Ron relaxed back in his chair. "Good. Store's doing well. We're going to see my Mum and Dad after this."Hermione was smiling slightly at Ron, her love for him clear on her face. She took his hand and began rubbing slow circles with her thumb. Harry's heart ached at the sight of it."She misses you, you know. Mum," Ron said quietly. He wasn't meeting Harry's eyes. "They all do, back home."Harry’s heart constricted in his chest. "I miss them too."Ron’s jaw was clenched and Harry could tell he was chewing on words that threatened to escape. Harry partially wanted Ron to just spit it out and get it over with, but the other part didn’t know if he could handle his best mate yelling at him on top of everything else.“You’ll be able to see everyone soon enough. Whenever you feel up to it, of course, but you know, you’ll be released tomorrow,” Hermione said as if Harry didn’t know this himself, “And I’ve got a good feeling – about it all – this time around. Really,” she added at Harry’s scoff. “The circumstances are different and you’ve been doing so well…”Harry looked away, embarrassed. He could admit she had a point – he’d never been to St. Mungo’s for it, and he honestly couldn’t remember the last time he’d been clean for this long – but he still didn’t have nearly the same amount of faith Hermione apparently had in him. “Ginny’s also told us that you were thinking of going outside. Did that…ever happen?” asked Hermione in a small voice.Harry shook his head, not looking at them. He spoke to his hands.“No,” he said, annoyed at himself. “No, I reckon I overestimated myself. I’m still too bloody anxious for that. I’ll try – later.”He didn’t know when ‘later’ would be, but he knew he’d have to do it eventually. For now, he’d rather face mind-numbing boredom via being cooped up in the room over having to face reality.“That’s alright. You’ve got loads of time,” said Hermione reassuringly.It was the opposite of reassuring to Harry, however, because he was forced to think about how he’d have to deal with all this shit for the rest of his life. To some degree, at least, he would be forced to reckon with his addiction until his last day. He knew too well that he would relapse at some point. It was an inevitability, a harsh one. Somehow, somewhere, he would break and fall apart and have to go through this all over again. There was no magic cure, no special switch – there you go, you’re no longer an addict! Congratulations!This was his lot in life now; this is what he’d done to himself. A shitty, never-ending battle. He almost wished he was fighting against Voldemort again.“Harry?”“I’m fine,” he mumbled, feeling hollow.Hermione was looking at him with concern in her eyes. Even Ron looked worried, all the tension in his body gone.“I’m fine,” repeated Harry with more fervor in his voice, hating the way they were looking at him.“You’re seeing that Mind Healer again tomorrow, right?” asked Ron hesitantly.Harry nodded.“Good.”“Harry,” said Hermione softly, placing a hand on his own. He tensed slightly at the touch but relaxed a moment later. “Do you want us with you when you leave? Or will Ginny be enough?”He had his answer already. He’d been imagining leaving this damned place for the past two weeks, and he’d known for a while that he only wanted Ginny with him when he left. Less chance of attracting attention that way, and less people fretting over him.Harry gave an apologetic grimace, and Hermione nodded, understanding, and pulled her hand back.“Alright. Just send us an owl when you’re ready for us to visit. No rush, Harry,” she added quickly.“Yeah, course.”Harry was filled with dread.Not about his appointment with Wolff, of course. He was actually sort of…excited for it in a way. No, he was dreading seeing Malfoy. Harry hadn’t spoken or even seen him since his confession two days past, with only Betty coming in to take his vitals and note his progress now. He’d been filled with a mix of relief and hurt – was Malfoy that put off by him that he’d send a trainee Healer in his stead? But of course, the last thing Harry had done was tell him to fuck off, so maybe Malfoy took it to heart.Harry checked the clock that hung menacingly on the wall. Two minutes. Two minutes, and Malfoy would be here to escort him to his office and let him Floo to Wolff’s.He groaned. Why’d he have to say anything in the first place? He could’ve just kept his stupid attraction bottled up and never had spoken a word of it. Malfoy has always had a talent of getting under his skin, knowing exactly which buttons to push to best rile him up. And it didn’t help that his temper had just grown shorter and shorter over the years, rivaling that of his fifteen-year-old self.“Fucking Malfoy,” cursed Harry under his breath, and then Fucking Malfoy himself entered the room after the briefest of knocks.Harry wiped the sweat off his palms on his trousers and tried to keep a neutral face as he met Malfoy’s gaze. Malfoy was doing a better job of it than he was, Harry was certain, with his grey eyes indiscernible and mouth set in a familiar line.“Good morning, Potter,” said Malfoy calmly. “Are you ready?”Harry nodded, unable to speak.Malfoy withdrew his wand. “Would you like me to cast the Disillusionment charm on you?”“Yeah,” Harry said quickly.Malfoy did so. Before Harry had gotten used to the feeling, Malfoy had already stowed his wand and turned toward the door. Harry hurried to catch up as Malfoy set off towards his office, swerving to avoid colliding with people who couldn’t see him.All the while, his eyes were glued to Malfoy’s back, burning a hole through his lime green robes. We wanted to say something to him – but what? He felt so incredibly stupid and desperately wished that he could take it all back. But from the six words he’d uttered to Harry, it was clear that Malfoy didn’t wish to talk to him.They’d gotten to Malfoy’s office without incident and Harry slipped inside after Malfoy.Malfoy undid the charm with a flick of his wand and checked his watch.“It’s two till ten,” informed Malfoy.“Right,” said Harry. “Malfoy, could we talk?”His gaze returned to Harry at these words, his eyebrows raised in interest. He stowed his wand away and calmly asked, “About what?”“You know what,” Harry answered impatiently. He stepped closer. “Don’t play dumb.”“There’s nothing to talk about,” Malfoy said, taking a step backward. “I appreciate your honesty, but I am still your Healer and you are still my patient.”“For a few more hours!”Malfoy gave Harry a look he couldn’t quite read, then looked down at his watch again.“It’s 9:59. You wouldn’t want to be late.”Scowling, Harry grabbed some Floo powder from the mantel and tossed it into the fire.“Julia Wolff’s office,” Harry snapped, and when the flames turned green, he stepped in without a backwards glance.He tumbled into Wolff’s office a few seconds later, bringing soot in with him. Harry stood and brushed himself off, then looked up.“Good morning, Harry.” Wolff was sitting behind her desk with impeccable posture and a small albeit kind smile.“Morning, Healer Wolff,” replied Harry.He went to sit.“And how are you, Harry? How has the past week treated you?”What a loaded question. Harry exhaled and looked away, trying to think without getting unnerved by Wolff’s intense gaze.“I’m ready to leave St. Mungo’s, for one,” Harry said.And Malfoy.“That’s understandable,” Wolff nodded. “What else?”“I dunno,” he said, pushing Malfoy out of his mind. He tried to think of what else he’d been feeling the past week. “I feel like…I can’t even keep track of what I’m feeling. One minute I feel like something horrible is going to happen, the next all I can think about is using, and the next I’m just angry.”Wolff nodded, writing notes as he spoke.“It’s just – I have no reason to be angry, but I am. And it happens in a split second, and I know the people I lash out at don’t deserve it, but I still can’t stop myself. I feel like I’m pushing everyone away, which is ironic since realistically, I’ve been pushing my friends away for the past few years. And they’re still here, for some reason.”“They’re still here because they love you, Harry,” said Wolff, looking down at him with a soft expression on her face.“Well, I don’t deserve it,” Harry said, slipping down a bit in his seat.“What makes you say that?”Harry fought the urge to roll his eyes. “I’ve been lying to them and practically ignoring them for years now. I’ve made more effort to see my dealers than the two people who were with me during the most important parts of my life. I left their engagement party early to drink alone, and I didn’t even know why. I should’ve been happy there, right? Celebrating with my two best friends and spending time with good people? But I wasn’t, so I left. I gave them some weak excuse and they let me go.”He breathed out and suddenly realizing just how much he’d spoken in a relatively short amount of time. Wolff was looking at him, unaware or uncaring of his sudden and slight embarrassment.“Did they know?” At Harry’s puzzled expression, Wolff elaborated. “Did they know you’d gone to drink alone?”Harry shrugged. “Probably. It was obvious that something wasn’t…right at that point, and when they’d come over to my flat, I either didn’t have time or didn’t care enough to hide the evidence.”“And how long ago was this?”Harry struggled to remember. “Maybe a year ago.”“Have you ever talked to them about this?”Harry shook his head, unwilling to tell her that he was afraid to.“You may want to,” Wolff advised. “Honesty is essential to recovery from drug and alcohol addiction. They would most likely feel appreciative and reassured by your telling the truth, and some of your guilt may be alleviated. Regardless, I find it very hard to believe that Ms. Granger and Mr. Weasley believe that you are undeserving of their friendship.”Harry raised an eyebrow, and Wolff smiled.“I’ve been doing some more research,” she told him. “The more I know about you, the better I can treat you.”“Well, Hermione and Ron are easy,” Harry said, amused. “Everyone knows about them. And anyway, it all depends on your sources. If you’re reading rubbish like Skeeter, you’re going to have a lot of bad information.”“I have, in fact, read Skeeter’s biography on you, though with a grain of salt. I tried to find material that was objective as possible, though, considering it’s journalism, objectivity is impossible. Still, I managed to find some illuminating information.”Harry didn’t like the sound of that, and Wolff gave an apologetic look.“It seems like the rumor that you dislike your fame is in fact true.”Harry scoffed. “Dislike might be too weak a word for it.”“And why do you dislike it so much?”“I never asked for this. And besides, it’s a bloody stupid thing to be famous for, not dying when you were a baby, and then killing your dead parents’ murderer.”He gritted his teeth and trained his eyes to the floor. Harry wondered what his parents would think of him if they knew what he’d become. If they knew where he was and why. Would they still be proud of him? Or would they be disappointed? Perhaps even disgusted at the way he turned out? At the way he spoke about them so coarsely?“You seem a little irritated, Harry. Unusually so. Did something happen before you arrived?”“Malfoy’s a git,” said Harry before he could stop himself.Wolff blinked – it was the first time he’d seen her even a little surprised – but collected herself quickly.“And why is that?”Harry scoffed. “We’d be here all day if I listed all the reasons.”“Give me a few, then.”“Alright,” said Harry, up for the challenge. He counted them off on his fingers. “He’s rude, arrogant, patronizing, dismissive – and he was a prejudiced wanker ‘till just a few years ago.”“But did he do something to upset you before you arrived?”Harry nodded tersely.“Would you like to talk about it?”Harry shook his head.Wolff nodded.“If I were to believe what Ms. Skeeter has written, I would think that you and Healer Malfoy have had a turbulent relationship ever since you were children.”“That’s one way to put it,” Harry mumbled.“But then,” Wolff continued, “I recall seeing something in the papers about you testifying at Healer Malfoy’s trial, ultimately helping him evade Azkaban.”Harry winced. “Evade makes it sounds like he should’ve gone. I just – helped him. He didn’t deserve to be locked up in Azkaban. Nor did his mum.”“I see,” said Wolff. “You still hold this opinion?”“Yeah,” said Harry quietly.“So would you say your animosity towards him is gone for the most part, at least?”Harry shrugged noncommittally. And then it sunk in that he was discussing Malfoy in fucking therapy. This is how he knew he’d actually and unequivocally gone mental.“And yet, you still speak of him in this way. You say he’s rude and arrogant.”“Cos he is,” Harry cut in. “Just cos he doesn’t deserve to be in Azkaban doesn’t mean he’s not a wanker anymore.”“Hm,” said Wolff, writing something in her notes. “Was it difficult to have Healer Malfoy as your Healer these past two weeks? Considering your history…”“I mean I was definitely shocked when I woke up to Malfoy,” Harry admitted, “But it was fine after the first few days. We actually got on, mad as it is to say it…”The until went unsaid, and Wolff’s eyebrows rose.“He – well, we had, er, an argument a few days ago,” Harry said nervously, looking away. “So it’s been a bit difficult again.”“What was the argument about?”“It…” Harry trailed off without having said anything. There had to be a line somewhere, right? His face warmed as he said as firmly as he could, “I’d rather not say.”Wolff nodded.“That’s fine, Harry,” she said.“Welcome back, Potter,” said Malfoy as soon as Harry had tumbled onto his floor.Harry stood up and half-glared at Malfoy.“Thanks,” he said gruffly.Malfoy looked at him with something that might have been pity and withdrew his wand.“Ready?”Harry nodded, and Malfoy performed the Disillusionment Charm. As soon as the egg-feeling was gone, Harry turned away and made for the door. Malfoy, apparently too taken-aback to respond immediately, only moved when Harry had already left the office.He walked briskly back to his hospital room (for the last time) and walked inside. He went to sit on his bed and waited for Malfoy to come in. A few moments later, Malfoy’s lime robes and white-blond hair came into view. Malfoy shut the door behind him, ended the charm, and fixed a stern gaze onto Harry.“What?” asked Harry defensively, crossing his arms.Malfoy stared at him for a bit longer before sticking a hand in his robes and pulling out a plain, overstuffed file folder – his files. Harry looked at them with curiosity, wondering what sort of information Malfoy had on him. It was a bit unsettling, to be honest, to know that such a gigantic prat had that much power over him.“We’ve a few things to do before you’re to be discharged.”“Fine,” said Harry, his eyes going back up to Malfoy’s face. “What do I have to do?”Malfoy sat down at one of the chairs in front of Harry, rather too close for comfort. He opened up the file folder and withdrew a piece of parchment; he set it on top of the closed file and pulled out a self-inking quill. Harry sat back on the bed, the sight of his and Malfoy’s knees so close together unsettling him.“I’ll need you to fill out this form and update your contact information, please.”He passed the parchment and quill over to Harry and transfigured the other visitor’s chair into a small desk. Harry put the parchment down on the desk and began filling it out – his street address, his emergency contacts, and Harry was surprised to find a line for a phone number. The wizarding world was really evolving, thought Harry with wonder as he filled in his own mobile number.Once done, Harry gave the parchment back to Malfoy.“Excellent, thank you,” said Malfoy, sliding it into the folder. He then withdrew another piece of parchment. “This is a contract stating that you will see Mind Healer Julia Wolff once a week until she sees fit to release you. If you miss an appointment and fail to contact her within 24 hours, staff at the Potions and Plant Department are authorized to visit your place of residence in an effort to locate you.”Harry nodded, and when Malfoy passed it to him, he signed and dated it.“And this,” said Malfoy, pulling out yet another piece of parchment and handing it to Harry, “Is a list of resources for you. You can contact Healer Wolff or myself at any time, day or night. The addresses I included there are our work addresses, but if need be, an owl will be able to locate us at our homes. I’ve also included some other reputable Mind Healers if things don’t work out with Healer Wolff.”Harry nodded again and looked down at the parchment. Written neatly was indeed Wolff’s and Malfoy’s names and the addresses of their workplace. Below that were the names of four Mind Healers in the area and their own work addresses. He thanked Malfoy, folded the parchment into a square, and stuffed it into his pocket.“Right,” said Malfoy with a note of finality, “I will now check your vitals one last time. Afterwards, we’ll contact Ginevra and have her collect you.”“And my wand?” said Harry, itching to have it back in his possession.“Before you leave,” Malfoy answered as he stood up.He raised his wand and preformed the spells that had become so familiar to Harry the last two weeks. It was strange to think that it was (hopefully) the last time Malfoy would cast these spells on him. Harry watched Malfoy’s look of concentration, studying the furrow of his brow and the way a strand of white-blond hair fell in his eyes.As much as Harry disliked the git, he couldn’t stem the wave of attraction that rushed over him. He hated himself for still thinking of Malfoy in this way when the man was clearly uninterested, almost aggressively so. Biting his lip, he looked away.“All done. You seem to be perfectly healthy,” said Malfoy after a moment. “I’ll go owl Ginevra – she should be here shortly.”“Right.”They looked at each other for a few seconds; Harry couldn’t understand the expression on Malfoy’s face. It was curious. Despite the way he was clearly trying to appear distant and professional, Harry thought he could see a hint of…sadness. Or guilt, perhaps. Was it possible? What did Malfoy have to be sad about?“Well,” Malfoy said, clearing his throat and standing up even straighter. “This is it, Potter. I just wanted to say…it’s been a pleasure treating you and I am…very proud of all the progress you’ve made these past two weeks. And like I said, if you need anything, you can contact me anytime.”“Right,” Harry repeated, his heart caught in his throat. He urged himself to speak. “Thanks, Malfoy. For…everything.”Malfoy gave a stiff nod, and with a final searching look, left Harry’s room.Harry let out the heavy breath he’d apparently been holding and wiped his palms on his jeans. What was Malfoy playing at? He’d been completely closed off this morning, not wanting to speak to Harry in the slightest, but then he’d gone and went all soft on Harry, telling him he could talk to him at any time?Merlin, he was infuriating.Harry blinked as he and Ginny appeared in his flat.The first thing he noticed was the smell. The flat was musty and stale and Harry wrinkled his nose, wondering if it’s always smelled like this. He glanced over at Ginny to see if she’d noticed the stink as well, and she gave him a lopsided smile.“Foul, isn’t it?” she asked him. “Suppose you never noticed cos you were so used to it.”“Christ,” Harry said, and went over to one of the windows. He pulled it open with a grunt, pushing it as far up as it will go. He stuck his head out the window and took a deep breath of clean air. When he’d gotten his fill, he withdrew his head and turned to Ginny. “Could you help me open all of them?”She did, and within minutes the two of them had opened every window in the flat.“Right,” said Ginny, putting her hands on her hips. “Second order of business is dumping all the rubbish you’d gone and gotten yourself addicted to.”When he opened his mouth, her brown eyes fixed him with a glare and she answered his unasked question. “Down the loo.”Harry couldn’t gather the will to do it himself, so he followed along miserably as Ginny marched around and collected assorted bottles of liquor and potions. Her arms were full as she led them to the bathroom.“Say goodbye,” said Ginny cheerfully, and began pouring out the contents into the toilet.The sharp smell of liquor filled Harry’s nostrils, and he had to stop himself from breathing in deep. He watched, throat parched, as Ginny unscrewed each bottle, held it ceremoniously in front of her, and let the liquid inside pour cleanly into the toilet. Harry wondered vaguely what Ginny would do if he swiped one from right in front of her and ran away. He shuddered.Once done, she flushed and smiled at Harry. “There, that’s done. Now, show me all of your Muggle drugs.”Harry nibbled at his bottom lip, wondering if he really had to show all of them to her. It had to be at least a couple of hundreds of pounds’ worth.“Harry,” Ginny warned, not taking kindly to his hesitation, “I’ll call Ron and Hermione over and the three of us will flip this entire place over if we have to.”“Medicine cabinet,” said Harry glumly, nodding his head in the direction of it.He stepped away from the sink as Ginny leaned over it and opened said cabinet. A couple of Muggle prescription bottles greeted them, some lined up and a few knocked over. The contents of only a few of them matched their labels; the generic versions of Xanax and Valium. Others held a variation of bud, and one coke. Ginny scooped them up and inspected each closely.“Fascinating,” Ginny murmured. “Dad would love this stuff. Not the drugs, the labels. It’s like a different language.”“Hm,” said Harry, his fingers itching for them. His heart jumped to his throat as Ginny began to try to open one of the containers. “I – do you – I mean, we don’t need to dump it, right?”“Yes, we really do,” replied Ginny. She frowned and tried again to unscrew the cap. “Why can’t I – ?”“Here,” said Harry, and he took it from her.“Harry!” she yelped and reached for the bottle.“Oi,” Harry scowled, pulling it back out of her reach. He opened the container and passed it back to her. “There.”She looked at him warily, then down at the pills, and then back up.“They make them childproof,” explained Harry. “You’ve got to press down and turn.”“Hmph,” said Ginny, and she dumped them down the toilet.Harry’s arm twitched like he wanted to reach out and save the pills from falling, but he restrained himself by crossing his arms across his chest. He watched as she binned the empty container, picked up a new one, opened it, and dumped its contents. She repeated these movements until she’d finished with all of them.Unable to help himself, Harry walked up and peered into the toilet. White powder was floating on top of the water, shifting and rocking and taunting.“You know it’s the right thing, Harry,” said Ginny firmly but not unkindly.“Yeah.”And then Ginny flushed. Harry watched his money, his habit, his livelihood swirl away and disappear from sight.Ginny put a hand around his waist and tugged him close, leaning her head against his shoulder. Harry sighed and put his arm round Ginny.“What’s next?”

Chapter Text
“So Mr. Potter has been released?”Draco nodded and pushed the paperwork for Potter’s final evaluation towards Scarlett. She picked it up and skimmed it, nodding and making affirmative hums as she did so. Once she’d finished, she put it back down on the desk.“Good, good,” Scarlett said, returning her gaze to Draco. “Now I’d like to hear about your findings. Did he seem to respond well to the treatment?”“Yes,” said Draco. “He was resistant at first, but with enough encouragement from his loved ones, he made the decision to work with us and complete treatment. The cleansing procedure worked perfectly, and you can see that his vitals were up to standard days before he left.”“And with therapy?”“He’s currently seeing Mind Healer Wolff once a week and will continue to do so for the foreseeable future. We have consent to visit Potter if he fails to show up to an appointment.”“Good. How did he seem today?”Draco paused. “He did seem rather…irritated this morning, but his mood improved considerably once we’d begun talking about his discharge. By the time Ginevra Weasley arrived and he got his wand back, he seemed to be in good spirits.”“Excellent. And I suppose Miss Weasley will be his most immediate support system?” Scarlett asked, raising her eyebrows.“Yes. I gave her some resources on aiding those in recovery, our contact information, and an emergency plan before she left.”“Alright. Well done, Draco.” She gave him a grim smile. “Let’s hope we never see Mr. Potter again.”Draco agreed distractedly and left Scarlett’s office. He did want to see Potter again. Not in St. Mungo’s, but anywhere else would do.
Draco and Leo had just finished tending to a patient when they were ambushed by both Ira and Betty in the corridor. Ira had a devious look on their face, and Betty’s cheeks were flushed. Draco raised an eyebrow. Whatever they wanted couldn’t possibly be good.“What is it?” asked Draco immediately, his eyes shifting from Ira to Betty.“When are you off?” Ira asked instead of answering.Draco checked his watch. It was half past three. “I suppose I could leave around five. There’s not much left for me to do.”“Brilliant. And you, Leonel?”“I’m on ‘till seven.”“Alright. We were thinking of going out for drinks,” Ira explained, gesturing towards Betty.Draco looked at Betty critically, and she blushed.“It’s Monday,” said Leo, saying exactly what Draco was thinking.“Time isn’t real, nothing matters, etcetera,” Ira waved their hands. “Come on, Leonel, Draco. Live a little. It’s been ages since we’ve gone out together, and Betty’s never been.”Betty’s face was hopeful, though still flushed a pale pink.“It’s still a Monday,” Draco reiterated.“Is Selina coming?” Leo asked.“No, she’s working night shift,” Betty said regretfully.“What about…” Draco snapped his fingers. “That new bloke in your department?”Ira looked horrified. “Merlin, no. Rodgers is a complete wet blanket. I don’t think the man could have fun even if he had a wand at his throat.”“And we know what happened the last time we invited Patterson out for drinks,” Draco mused. “Just us four then?”Ira beamed as Betty nodded enthusiastically.“You can’t rope me into this!” Leo argued.“You might as well surrender, Leo,” Draco told him. “There’s no use fighting it.”“We’ll meet at the Leaky at eight, then?” Ira asked happily over Leo’s weak refusal.“Is there a reason we’re meeting somewhere so common?”“Oh, relax, Draco,” Ira said. “The Leaky is a perfectly respectable establishment. And it won’t be so crowded since it’s a Monday.”“God. If I’m hungover tomorrow morning, I’m blaming all of you,” Leo told them, glaring at the three of them in turn.“That’s just on you, Leo,” Betty spoke up finally, smiling pleasantly.Ira laughed and put an arm round her shoulders.“Oh, Betty, I so look forward to drinking with you.”
Draco chose to wear Muggle clothes despite the fact that they were going to the Leaky; he’d been in robes long enough today. He Apparated outside the pub at eight o’clock exactly and headed inside, immediately on the lookout for his three coworkers.When he didn’t see any of them, he headed to the bar and ordered a gin and tonic. Stirring and sipping absentmindedly, he leaned against the bar and people-watched. He was in the middle of watching two young witches giggling and falling over each other when he felt someone come up beside him.“Butterbeer, please,” Leo was saying to the bartender. Once he’d gotten it, he smiled and turned towards Draco. “Hey, boss.”“Hello, Leo,” Draco said to him.He raised his drink and they cheers-ed. There was a silence as they both sipped at their drinks.“I wanted to apologize again for what I said. Last week,” elaborated Leo, and Draco suddenly understood. Before he could have a chance to speak, however, Leo began talking again. “You were right – it was completely unprofessional, especially since you’re my superior, and uh, yeah. I’m sorry.”“It’s already forgotten, Leo,” Draco said, waving the apology away. “Don’t worry about it.”Leo looked at him with skepticism. “Well. If you say so.”Draco watched as Leo took another long pull from his Butterbeer. He’d also chosen to wear Muggle clothes tonight, dressed in a t-shirt that advertised what Draco assumed to be an American Muggle band and dark-wash jeans. He looked good, Draco thought against his best interest, admiring Leo’s strong arms as he leaned back against the bar.“Hello, hello.”It was Ira and Betty once again, approaching the two men with matching smiles. Draco’s face warmed at the thought that they had seen Draco ogling Leo. They didn’t say anything about it, however, and instead ordered drinks.“Should we sit?” Betty asked, peering up at them from her cranberry vodka.The four of them found a table towards the back and sat down.Conversation flowed easily between them, going from work to hobbies to heated debates between English and American things and back to work. Draco had always liked going out with his coworkers because it allowed him to see a different side of them. You could never know someone purely from their work persona. Ever since he’d first been invited out by Ira, he’d been amused by what he could learn when his coworkers had gotten a bit of alcohol in them.For example, Betty had opened up brilliantly by the time she’d finished her drink. She could actually talk to Draco without blushing, which did wonders for the quality and length of their conversations.“I miss Harry already,” she said at one point, slumping forward and pouting slightly. “He was by far the nicest patient I’ve had in a while.”Draco caught Ira looking at him carefully, and so he chose to take a drink instead of answering her.“I don’t know about nice,” Leo put in. “Definitely interesting. I just don’t think he ever warmed up to me the way he did to you two.”“Hmm,” said Draco thoughtfully between his straw.“Well he wasn’t nice to anyone at first,” Betty pointed out.“Yeah, I know,” said Leo, the last word much longer than it needed to be, as he leaned forward and supported his argument through the use of excessive hand gestures. “I said that he didn’t warm up to me like he did you and Draco.”“You interrupted me before I finished,” Betty sniffed, turning away and looking up at the ceiling.“Oh, come on, what were you gonna say?”“I was going to say that I had to work to get him to like me. It didn’t happen instantaneously! I had to be extra nice,” she explained, fixing Leo with a stern look. “So maybe you were just not being nice enough.”As the two continued their drunken argument, Ira leaned over to speak lowly in Draco’s ear.“And how are you holding up with Mr. Potter gone?”“I don’t know,” Draco admitted. “Relieved because he’s not my patient anymore, but actually a little…upset that I can’t see him every day anymore.”Ira raised their eyebrows. “Who says you can’t?”Draco scoffed. “Hello, Potter, I know I’m not obligated to care for you anymore but here I am anyway? Oh, and I know you think I hate you and perhaps you hate me all over again too, but the truth is I’ve just fancied you since I was a teenager and still do today which is fucked up in several ways.”“Well you can’t show your hand that early in the game,” Ira grinned.“Fuck off.” Draco rolled his eyes.And then he caught Leo and Betty staring at the two of them. With a panic, Draco turned to Ira and asked, “How loudly was I speaking just then?”“Loud enough,” answered Leo helpfully.Ira nodded with a grimace.“Just…please…ignore everything I just said,” Draco said, feeling his cheeks heat up at an astonishing rate.Leo was looking at him wide eyes, a mixture of emotions on his face. Betty, on the other hand, looked like Christmas had come early.He avoided eye contact with the two of them, silently cursing himself for his stupidity and the way alcohol made him forget himself. It was obvious, however, that Betty and Leo would not be ignoring everything he’d just said, and Draco briefly considered Obliviating them.“May I remind you that I am your superior?” he tried weakly.“Healer Malfoy,” Betty began in a high voice, “Did you just say you fancy Harry?”“No,” Draco lied blatantly. “Of course not.”“Sounded to me like he said he’s fancied him for years, Betty,” Leo told her.“Wow,” said Betty simply.“Wait, is that why – oh,” Leo said, his voice suddenly full of understanding.He was looking at Draco seriously now instead of with lighthearted amusement. Draco tried to look back at him apologetically.“What’s happening?” Betty asked them, clearly lost.“Come, Betty,” said Ira, standing and placing a hand on her shoulder. When she looked up at them with confusion, they said, “We’ll go get you another drink.”Draco thanked Merlin for Ira and waited until they were both out of earshot before speaking.“I’m sorry, Leo,” he said at once. “I swear to Salazar that I didn’t have feelings for Potter when we were dating. I hadn’t even seen him in – what, five years? It’s really just that I had a big, pathetic crush on him when we were in school and I’d just repressed it after the War. Well, until –“He stopped himself and glared down at the table. Merlin, he was certainly prone to rambling when he was drunk.“It’s ok, Draco, I believe you,” Leo said earnestly. He studied him for a moment, and then said, “Is he why you don’t want to get back together?”Draco sighed and stirred his drink miserably.“Partly,” he admitted. “Which is ridiculous because I know it’ll never happen, but it wouldn’t be…right to be with you and not be fully devoted to you. But I also truly believe that we’re better as friends. And colleagues, of course.”“Yeah, ok,” Leo nodded. “I get it. It’s just – you’re…anyone would be lucky to have you.”He gave Draco a sad smile, and Draco’s heart ached. Why couldn’t Draco just be normal and fall happily in love with this charming, clever, ridiculously fit bloke who was obviously still into him? It would be so much easier than pining over some complicated git with whom Draco had so much ugly history with.“I think you’re confusing me with yourself,” Draco said wryly. “You deserve the best, Leo, and I’m not it.”Leo opened his mouth to argue when Betty and Ira returned.“Drinks for everyone,” Betty said happily, placing them at the center of the table.“Thank you, Betty,” Draco said, and she beamed at him.Draco glanced back over at Leo and gave an apologetic shrug; Leo frowned but held his tongue, unable to say anything with their companions back in earshot.
The next week passed much like they had done before Potter was reintroduced into his life. Draco threw himself into his work, putting in so many hours that even Ira looked at him concernedly from time to time. When he got home, he was usually too exhausted to do anything other than sleep and eat.When he was idle, his thoughts ultimately ventured towards Potter. He wondered how he was doing. He wondered what symptoms he was experiencing, if any. He wondered if Ginevra was still living with Potter, acting as a friend and watcher. He wondered how that was going. He made a mental note to write an Owl to Blaise later.Things with Leo were a bit stilted ever since pub night. Leo was never one to get embarrassed or abashed easily, but Draco thought he might’ve been avoiding him recently. Whenever they had to work together, Draco noticed that Leo wasn’t so easy-going – there were less jokes and less effortless grins. Draco figured that the thing with Potter had affected him more than he let on, and Draco wasn’t quite sure how to fix it.It was disconcerting, to say the least. The last time their relationship had been so strained was right after they’d broken up. It wasn’t as bad, thank Merlin, but it worried Draco all the same. Sometimes, he even caught Betty looking at him with almost reproachfully, which might’ve been the worst part about it. She’s never regarded Draco with anything other than admiration or slight fear before.
 When Draco had finally written Blaise and asked about Ginevra and Potter, Blaise had simply written back, ‘why do you care, you berk.’
 It took him a few times, but Draco managed to write a response. ‘Because he was my patient.’
As expected, Blaise saw right through him and his flimsy half-truth. He advised Draco that if he cared so much about the bloke, he should just go see him, which Draco thought to be some of the worst advice he had ever gotten.Draco chose not to respond to this particular Owl, so when he heard an insistent tapping on his office window six days later, he thought it’d be Blaise again. When he’d looked up, however, he was greeted by the sight of a Little Owl with stern, white eyebrows instead of the handsome Northern Hawk Owl that belonged to Blaise. Curious, Draco opened his window and allowed the strange owl to hop inside. He took the envelope from the owl and opened it up.Inside was a piece of parchment which read, ‘Malfoy, Blaise tells me you’re asking about Harry. He’s fine. If you don’t believe me, we could all go out for a cuppa sometime. Yes, even without Blaise there. Let me know. –Ginny’Embarrassment flooded through Draco’s body, and then irritation towards Blaise for telling his girlfriend what was meant to be confidential material. He wondered what Ginevra was thinking of him now that she knew he was still thinking about his ex-patient three weeks after his release. She didn’t sound mad, at least. In fact, she didn’t sound much of anything. Unsettled and ashamed, Draco stuffed the letter back into its envelope and shooed the owl away. For the rest of the day, Draco’s mind drifted back to Ginevra’s letter. He couldn’t help but entertain the idea of having lunch with Potter (and her). It would be good to see him; it’d set Draco’s mind at ease to see him be well, and they’d finally get some closure on their…whatever it was. And Draco wouldn’t be Potter’s Healer anymore. No constraints. No boundaries to be worried about crossing. They’d be able to speak freely; Draco would be able to speak freely.This was Draco’s rationale as he wrote a letter in the affirmative to Ginevra that night.
Draco stood outside the Muggle patisserie with trepidation. He peered inside through the windows, his hands stuffed in his coat pockets. It was fairly busy, people of all ages going in and out with coffee and pastries. He could catch a glimpse of bright red hair towards the back of the shop.With a deep breath and a glance at his watch, Draco slipped inside.He shrugged his coat off as he approached Potter and Ginevra, who were sat side-by-side in a booth. They were deep in conversation, the drinks in front of them forgotten, and didn’t notice Draco until he’d cleared his throat. The two of them started and looked up. Ginevra greeted him with a smile that was a bit too mischievous for his liking and said, “Glad you could make it, Malfoy.”Draco nodded as he draped his coat over the back of the unoccupied chair. He glanced hesitantly over at Potter, who looked…fine. Still much too skinny and with heavy bags under his eyes, but he didn’t look so close to death. Draco breathed a silent sigh of relief and told them that he was going to go get some food.When he’d come back with a latte and an éclair, Ginevra was gone. Potter looked at him glumly.“She said she had to ‘leave,’” he explained as Draco sat down slowly, placing air quotes around the last word. “As if this wasn’t just a big ploy to get us together.”Draco suddenly felt warm and tugged at his too-tight collar. “Ah.”“I think Zabini’s had a bad influence on her,” Potter mumbled, fiddling with a teaspoon.“Bollocks,” said Draco. “She’s always been conniving.”Potter smirked. “Still bitter about a certain hex, Malfoy?”Draco tried for a weak glare.“Shut it, Potter.”They fell into an uncomfortable silence, and Draco thought that this was the opportune time to begin eating. Halfway through his second bite, Potter spoke.“This is weird, isn’t it?”Surprised by Potter’s bluntness, Draco could only nod. He finished chewing and swallowed, trying his best to choose his next words carefully.“Perhaps,” said Draco. “If I may ask, how did Ginevra convince you to come?”Potter avoided eye contact as he answered. “Said she was meeting you for a bite to eat and said I should come along. Better than being cooped up or whatever.”“I admit I’m surprised that you’re still here.”“Yeah, well.” Potter shrugged. “I reckon some part of me wanted to see you anyway.”Draco was once again too stunned to speak by Potter’s honesty.“And I reckon you wanted to see me, too,” Potter added with a slight smile.He made eye contact with Draco then, his green eyes glinting in the light. Draco flushed slightly, his cheeks growing warm. Potter’s smile widened.“Yes, I did,” Draco confessed. “I feel…bad about what happened, and I suppose I wanted to clear the air.”Potter cocked his head. “What d’you mean?”“I couldn’t – Potter, I was your Healer. And I meant it when I said there’s good reason addicts in recovery are advised against new relationships. No, let me finish,” he said when Potter opened his mouth. “I’m not patronizing you, Potter. I’m looking out for your best interests. New relationships are destabilizing, and your life right now is unstable enough as it is.”“I’ve been clean for over a month,” Potter hissed under his breath, suddenly angry and leaning closer to Draco over the table.“I’m very happy to hear that, but it’s early days yet,” Draco replied calmly. At Potter’s sour look, he sighed. “At any rate, you’re not letting me finish. I feel badly about how it all went down at Mungo’s, and I want to apologize. So I’m sorry for goading you into revealing something you could’ve kept secret from me. I shouldn’t have pushed you, even though I really was concerned about your mental health.”“It’s fine, Malfoy,” Potter said, though it didn’t seem to be fine at all by the way he was glaring at a spot over Draco’s shoulder.“You also seemed to get the wrong impression from me,” Draco said hesitantly. His change in tone made Potter look him in the eye again, his expression a little less hard. “I don’t – well, that is to say, I –”“Spit it out, Malfoy.”Potter had leaned back against the booth again, regarding Draco with cautious eyes. His arms were crossed and his mouth was set in a frown, but his voice had no real vehemence in it. Draco pushed forward.“You seemed to think I was repulsed by your, um…” Draco trailed off. He didn’t want to say ‘crush,’ he really didn’t want to say ‘crush.’Potter raised his eyebrows. “And weren’t you?”“No, no, I wasn’t,” Draco said quickly. He frowned down at his untouched latte. “I was just surprised. I would’ve never thought that you’d…I had to act professionally as your Healer. I couldn’t tell you that I think I feel the same way.”And finally it was Potter’s turn to be stunned into silence. Draco watched him with apprehension, watching as he processed Draco’s words.“But the point remains that you should avoid new relat –““Shut up, Malfoy.”Draco fell silent. Was Potter mad? Upset? Irritated, most likely, if the look on his face told Draco anything.“So,” Potter began impatiently, scratching the back of his head and making his hair stick up more, “So what are you saying?”“I just didn’t want you to have the wrong impression from me,” Draco said again. “That’s all. I…admire you, Potter, and I liked the way we actually got on for a moment there. Still, nothing can come of it because – ““Why?”“Because your recovery is more important,” Draco said. “You’ve got to figure out who you are as a person again without the drugs. Any new relationship would be a distraction from staying sober, or worse, a substitute for the drugs, that is to say, something to be dependent on. It would mean a greater risk of relapse in the case things go wrong in the relationship.”Potter seemed to be listening to what Draco was saying, which was a good sign, but he still didn’t look happy.“So how long until you can start one?”Draco paused. “A year is the general consensus.”Potter looked outraged. “A year?”“You’ve got enough on your mind right now, Potter,” Draco said sternly, “And more than enough to keep you busy. You’ve got to focus all of your energies on – ““Yeah, I get it,” Potter growled.They sat in silence for a minute, Draco watching Potter carefully and wondering if he’d done the right thing in coming here. Maybe even this was too much for Potter; if Draco was the cause of a relapse, he didn’t know if he could ever forgive himself.Thankfully, when Potter spoke again, he didn’t sound angry. Just tired. “I thought you weren’t meant to be my Healer anymore.”This surprised a small laugh out of Draco. “Instinct, I suppose.”“Right,” Potter said, and even gave a slight smile.Draco smiled back, then said, “It’s not set in stone, you know. That one should wait a year. It could be more of a recommendation.”“Right,” Potter said again. He looked down. “I reckon I understand. It’s just frustrating.”Draco didn’t know what to say to that. He took a sip of his latte, which had gone cold. Wrinkling his nose, he set the mug down and looked at Potter.“How have you been?”“Fine,” Potter said, his green eyes flitting upward to meet Draco’s. “I haven’t relapsed, if that’s what you’re asking.”“I wasn’t,” Draco lied. “I’m glad to see you’re doing well.”“Er, thanks.”“You’re welcome.”“You said…that you'd gone to see Wolff before,” Potter said then, his voice causal but his mouth pulled into a nervous frown.Interesting, thought Draco. This wasn’t something he thought Potter would bring up.“I did,” he answered.“When? For how long?”“I was twenty-two when I first went to see her. And I’d only stopped going about a year ago.”“Oh,” Potter said, blinking at him.“Yes, I probably should had gone earlier than that,” Draco confessed, “But I wasn’t ready for it so soon after the War. And then my studies took over, and it was only until I’d gotten comfortable in my position as a Healer that I couldn’t ignore it all anymore.”“All?” Potter repeated. At Draco’s raised eyebrow, Potter scoffed and rolled his eyes. “Oh, come off it, Malfoy. You know all my shit; shouldn’t I know some of yours too?”“Fair enough,” Draco said with a light laugh. He looked down and straightened out his shirt carefully. “Though it’s not at as interesting as you might think. Just your average war trauma.”When he looked back up, he saw Potter’s skeptical face.“Not everyone had Voldemort living in their house.”Draco flinched at the name, despite it being years since he died. Since Potter killed him. It was unnerving talking to Potter, of all people, about this.“Well, yes,” Draco said slowly. He avoided Potter’s gaze as he spoke. “I just…had nightmares. Like you said, He lived in my house and it was far from the greatest year of my life.  Thus, the average war trauma.”He chanced a look at Potter; he seemed unsatisfied.“Fine, what do you want me to say, Potter? I anguished and tormented myself over all the choices I made during the War? Fine, it’s true. I do. There’s still not a day that goes by where I don’t feel regret, but you know something else? I’ve made peace with it because there’s nothing I can do to change it now, and even if I could, there’s some things I would do all over again if it meant keeping my family safe. Even if it meant taking this again.”He brandished his left forearm then, his face burning up as he pulled his sleeve back and Potter looked down at the faded red Mark impassively. Draco’s heart was still racing as he pushed the sleeve back down and lowered his arms.“So Wolff helped you figure all that out, then?” Potter asked finally.“Yes,” Draco said, his face still warm. “She did.”Potter nodded. “Good. I’m glad.”Draco looked at him in surprise.“Don’t look like that, Malfoy. You think I want you to be miserable?” Draco shook his head hollowly, and Potter continued in a matter-of-fact tone. “You’re right, you had to make hard choices – but in my eyes, you’ve already paid the price several times over. I mean you’re a bloody Healer now. And I won’t forget that you saved my life.”Draco flushed all over again. “That’s very…kind of you, Potter.”Potter brushed him off. “It’s the truth.”“Still,” Draco said, looking him in the eye again. How were they so vibrant? So green? Draco couldn’t stop staring at them. “Thank you.”Potter grinned, and Draco’s heart fluttered.“Anyway,” said Potter, checking his watch, “Don’t you have work? I’m not keeping you, am I?”Draco checked his own and started when he saw that it was already fifteen past eleven.“I’m so sorry, Potter, but I actually do need to get to work,” he said as he scrambled to stand and put on his coat. Potter’s brows were furrowed as he watched Draco pull it on. “I didn’t realize how much time had passed. But I…” He hesitated for just a second. “But I’d like to do this again. If you would.”Potter stood as well and began to put on a battered leather jacket, because of course he would have a battered leather jacket.“Yeah, I would,” he answered with a grin. “Owl me, yeah? I reckon your schedule is a bit more demanding than mine.”“I will, Potter,” Draco nodded. He wrapped up his éclair in a napkin and frowned at Potter apologetically. “But I do really have to go, I’m sorry.”Potter flapped a hand in his direction. “Go, Malfoy. You’ve got people to save, I get it.”“Now that I believe.”And then he strode off, leaving behind a cold latte and Potter, a confused expression on his face.

Chapter Text
As soon as Harry had arrived back to his flat, he’d yelled out Ginny’s name. She looked up from where she was lounging on the sofa, apparently watching telly and helping herself to Harry’s biscuits.“Yeah?”He glared at her as he shrugged off his jacket and hung it over the back of the sofa. He collapsed onto it by her feet.“Budge over, you traitor,” Harry grumbled. He nodded his head at the CSI rerun playing on the TV. “Is this what was so important you had to leave me alone with Malfoy?”Ginny, instead of sitting up and making space, laid her feet across Harry’s lap and smiled at him.“Yes. It’s not like it was the first time you were ever alone with Malfoy. How’d it go?”Harry tried to keep glaring at her. “Fine. I guess. I dunno.”“Go on, Harry. Use your words.”“He was nice,” Harry said after a moment. “And he told me…that he probably fancies me back. But he says nothing can happen cos I can’t start any new relationships for a year, apparently.”“Hmm,” said Ginny with a slight frown, but then her smile returned. “Well there you go. I knew he fancied you; he wouldn’t be asking Blaise about you if he didn’t.”“But what good is it if we can’t do anything?”“What, you want to shag him that badly?” Ginny asked, poking him with her foot. “I don’t recall you ever –““Ginny,” Harry gritted out, swatting at her foot with no real force. “It’s not just that, you know it. He – Malfoy’s been like…almost a completely different person, and I think I actually like that person. There’s bits and pieces that are still the same, but the important stuff, that’s different. He’s really…grown and improved.”“Yeah, I hope so,” Ginny scoffed. “He was a right wanker in school.”Harry nodded. “Completely.”“At least you recognize that.”“Course I do. I probably heard him insult my dead parents or Hermione or you lot at least once a week for six years straight, save holidays.”“And yet,” said Ginny.“And yet,” repeated Harry in a resigned way. “So Harry,” Wolff said, clasping her hands together. “How was your week?”“Alright, I guess,” Harry said noncommittally.Wolff raised her eyebrows. “Would you like to elaborate?”“I mean, it was just like the past two weeks, really,” Harry said. “I spend time with Ginny at home, mostly.”“What do you usually do with her?”Harry shrugged, chewing on his bottom lip and feeling guilty. “Not much. Watch telly, eat, sleep.”“I see,” Wolff was nodding. “You don’t need to feel badly about it, Harry. It’s quite normal that you find yourself with too much time on your hands now, given that much of your time before was likely spent using or buying.”“Yeah, I reckon that’s true,” Harry admitted.“Have you considered picking up a new hobby, or perhaps returning to an old one?”Harry thought. Had he?The only real hobbies he’d had the past few years were getting high or drunk, and they were rather all-consuming, not leaving much time, energy, or want for anything else. What did he like to do before? What made him happy? How did he function?Well, he never really had much time to be a regular person, did he? Harry’s thoughts turned bitter, and it must have showed on his face, for Wolff frowned.“What are you thinking about, Harry?”“I don’t – “ He stopped, then started again. “Er, I just, this is going to sound stupid, but I guess I never really had the chance to figure out what I like. I was too busy trying not to get killed by Voldemort for a good part of my life, and then…well really, I reckon I just like drugs.”“That isn’t all true, Harry, think. What did you do during your free time at Hogwarts?”“I’d always liked flying, I guess,” said Harry, “But I haven’t done that since…I dunno when.”“Alright. What else?”He tried to think of what else he’d liked to do, he really did.“God, I really don’t know,” Harry said. “I don’t.”“Well, how about we do a little assignment this week? I’d like you to think about the things that make you happy. Whether they are solitary activities, or ones you do with other people, I want you to make a list of them to bring for next time. Is that alright?”“Er, sure.”“Wonderful,” smiled Wolff.Harry couldn’t stop the thrill of delight going down his spine when he saw Malfoy’s owl outside his window six days later.“Whossit?” Ginny asked through a mouthful of crisps.Harry grimaced at her as he stood up, stretching out his back. They’d been lazing around Harry’s flat the whole day, much like they did most days. Harry still hadn’t finished that ‘list’ for Wolff, and that appointment had already been three days ago.“I dunno who’s going to be madder at you, Zabini or your coach.”“I’m off season!” Ginny told him indignantly, swallowing hard. “And I’ll hex Blaise if he even thinks about splitting up with me just because I might’ve gained a bit of weight. And sod off, Harry. I’ll hex you too.”“You wouldn’t,” said Harry, grinning at her before walking over to the window. He pulled it open and let Malfoy’s owl hop inside gracefully. Untying the scroll of parchment from its leg, Harry told Ginny, “It’s from Malfoy.”“Oooh,” said Ginny, waggling her eyebrows suggestively.Harry couldn’t stop his face from heating up as he unrolled the letter.
Potter – 

I’ll be free tonight around seven. Want to get something to eat? My treat.

D. Malfoy
He didn’t realize Ginny was talking to him until she’d stalked over and snatched the letter from his hands.“Hey!” Harry protested, but Ginny paid him no mind.Putting on her best Malfoy impression, Ginny read the letter aloud. Harry begrudgingly noted that her impersonation was really quite good, but he didn’t say so; he simply took the letter back from her. Ginny looked at him, brown eyes glittering.“Are you sure he said you two couldn’t date? Because that definitely sounded like he was asking you out on one.”“I…” said Harry and trailed off weakly, unable to think of a counterargument.Because it really did sound like Malfoy was asking him out on a date, and Harry really didn’t know what it meant.“Er…what do you think?”Harry stood awkwardly in front of Ginny, holding his arms out so she could adequately inspect her.Ginny pursed her lips, walking closer with one hand tapping her chin thoughtfully. She then reached out and touched the fabric of Harry’s jumper, a nice one he’d dug out from the back of his closest.“You look good,” she said finally, releasing his wrist. Her lips quirked into a smile as she met his gaze. “I’d bet a galleon that you never tried this hard when we were dating.”“I – ““And I’d win it,” Ginny interrupted confidently. “Y’know, if I wasn’t so happy with Blaise right now, I’d probably be jealous.”“Gin – ““It’s fine,” she went on, holding up a hand. “I’m completely over you, you dick.”Harry sighed. “You sure?”“Completely,” she said again.“Right,” Harry said, tugging on the bottom of the dark green jumper. “Anyway, it’s not a date. Malfoy and I aren’t dating.”Ginny raised an eyebrow. “You might want to tell Malfoy, then.”“I’ve half a mind to,” grumbled Harry. He turned away and picked up the second letter from Malfoy, telling him where to meet him for dinner. He tried pushing down the light, hopeful feeling in his stomach without much avail. “Right.”“Yes?”“I’m going to go now,” said Harry.“Then go.”But Harry didn’t.“This is stupid,” he said heatedly instead. “He’s the one who told me that we can’t start a relationship or whatever, but here he is, sending me these invitations to dinner, and saying they’re his treat? Who does that?”“Malfoy, apparently.”“I mean, it’s like he’s just leading me on, asking me out, and then he’s probably going to say, ‘No new relationships for a year, Potter’ again,” he said in his best Malfoy voice, “And then look at me like he wants to say something else, but he just leaves really abruptly instead.”“You’ve thought this through many times, haven’t you?” asked Ginny, and when Harry turned to glare at her, she sighed and put a hand on his shoulder. “It’ll be fine, Harry. This might be how Malfoy invites all his friends out to dinner. No ulterior motives.”Harry narrowed his eyes. “And this is the same Draco Malfoy we’re talking about?”“Oh, come on, Harry. You know he’s an alright bloke now. I don’t think he’s purposefully leading you on. I really don’t.”Harry made a disbelieving hmmph, and Ginny sighed again.“What would he get out of it?” Ginny asked, poking him in the shoulder. “Think about that. You said he fancies you too. Wouldn’t he just be hurting himself in the process too?”When Harry didn’t say anything, Ginny nodded resolutely.“Now go, or you’re going to be late.”“Alright,” said Harry, and thought of the address of the Apparition point Malfoy had sent him.He then gripped his wand and spun on the spot, becoming enveloped in the dark and spat back out in an alley. Harry let out a fortifying breath and looked around, seeing only Muggles. Relieved, he stuck his wand back in his pocket and walked out onto the sidewalk. On his left was the restaurant Malfoy had been talking about.Harry checked his watch; 7:01.Remembering Ginny’s words, he walked inside the restaurant. It looked quite posh, all sleek and black and modern inside. The maître d’ perked up at the sight of him.“Good evening!”“Hi, er, I’m supposed to meet someone here,” Harry said to her, peering back into the restaurant in hopes of catching sight of Malfoy. “Tall, pale, blond bloke.”“Yes, of course,” she said, nodding. She came out from behind her hostess stand and began walking into the dining room. “If you’d follow me, sir.”Harry did, but he’d only taken a few steps into the main dining floor when he caught a glimpse of Malfoy’s hair.“I got it,” Harry said, stopping the maître d’. “Thank you.”She nodded and walked away. Harry took another deep breath, then went over to Malfoy.The tightness in his chest only increased as he got closer and as Malfoy came into view. He looked incredible, beyond handsome in a crisp grey button-up and black slacks. His face was turned away towards the window, granting Harry a look at his profile; the long, straight nose, sharp jawline, and the smooth, pale expanse of his neck…Malfoy looked up then, seeming to feel Harry’s presence (or maybe his gaze), and gave a small smile.“Potter,” he said warmly. “Thank you for coming.”“Er, yeah,” Harry said, clearing his throat. He slid into the booth opposite Malfoy and clasped his hands together underneath the table. “Thanks for inviting me.”Malfoy passed him the menu. “This place has exceptional carbonara, if that’s your taste.”“Oh,” said Harry. He looked down at it in interest and skimmed the entrees. “Yeah, sounds great, Malfoy.”If Malfoy was going to say something then, Harry wouldn’t know; a young female server approached them with a smile plastered on her face.“Good evening, gentlemen. Have you ever dined with us before?” Harry shook his head, and Malfoy nodded. “Lovely. My name is Natasha, and I’ll be your server tonight. Could I start you two off with something to drink?”“Just water for me, thanks,” Harry said quickly.“And for me as well,” said Malfoy.“Alright, I’ll be right back with those waters. Thank you, gentlemen.”He watched her walk away, then looked at Malfoy.“You can get something else if you want to,” he said. At Malfoy’s frown, Harry elaborated, “You can drink something other than water; it’s fine.”The corners of Malfoy’s mouth turned up. “That’s very kind of you, Potter, but I assure you that I’m perfectly content with water.”“Alright,” Harry said, though not thoroughly convinced. “How’ve you been, Malfoy?”“I’ve been well,” said Malfoy, and then he went on to speak about his past week at St. Mungo’s.Harry listened, enraptured, able to tell just from Malfoy’s voice how much he cared about his work. Harry felt a twang of jealousy at that, wondering what it felt like to be that passionate about something. He watched as Malfoy’s expressions changed as he spoke of the different cases he’d had over the past week.He stopped only when the waitress came back and set their waters down on the table. The two men ordered their food, and they were alone once again. Harry swirled the straw around in his glass, watching the ice follow its uneven path.“So why’d you become a Healer in the first place? Did you always want to be one?”“I’m not certain if I’d always wanted to be one, per se, but it had been a goal of mine for quite a few years. I’ve always liked potions, and puzzles as well, and both factor into Healing,” Malfoy said. He paused, following Harry’s gaze and watching the ice swirling in Harry’s glass as well. “But I only began to think seriously about it when I went back to Hogwarts after the – the War. There aren’t many career options for former Death Eaters, I’ll tell you that much,” said Malfoy wryly. “Did you know it was McGonagall who really pushed me into pursing Healing?”Malfoy smirked at the bemused look on Harry’s face.“Yes, the Headmistress herself,” he said, his grey eyes far away. “I thought it was stupid that I’d gone back to Hogwarts in the first place – I thought it would be useless. NEWTS wouldn’t stack up against – against everything. But I think…with McGonagall’s letter of recommendation and your testimony, I was accepted into St. Mungo’s Trainee Healer program by the skin of my teeth. So I suppose I have you to thank, Potter.”“Harry,” he said automatically. At Malfoy’s look of surprise, Harry’s face heated up at an impressive rate, but he managed to keep eye contact with him. “Er, call me Harry, I mean.”“I…alright,” said Malfoy (or perhaps Draco), furrowing his brows. “Harry.”It sounded strange coming out of M-Draco’s mouth and sent an odd shiver down Harry’s spine. Emboldened by this, Harry straightened up and smiled.“I can still call you Healer Malfoy, if you’d like.”Draco scoffed. “What do you mean, ‘still’? You never called me by my title.”“Touché,” conceded Harry. He grinned down at his glass before looking at Draco again. “Anyway, I’m – I’m glad. That my testimony helped. And that McGonagall helped you out too. I never knew that. But, I mean, I never even knew you’d become a Healer. I think Hermione mentioned once, years ago, that you’d gone back to Hogwarts too, but…I dunno. I reckon I stopped paying attention at some point. To everything, almost.”Draco nodded, his mouth set in a slight frown.“I certainly don’t blame you,” he said. “The Prophet is ruthless, even towards their so-called Savior. And really, you didn’t miss much. Just a few articles insinuating I’d Imperioed my way into the program or that I’d only become a Healer in the first place to poison innocents.”“Oh, so just the highlights then.”“Exactly.”And then they were both smiling at each other, and Harry was so overtaken by the urge to lean over the table and kiss Draco that he had to grip the edges of his seat.“Draco, I –“The other man had a clearly visceral reaction to Harry saying his name, and it only increased the fluttery feeling in Harry’s stomach. He looked at Harry as though it pained him and leaned away, crossing his arms across his chest.“Don’t,” he said.“But I never even – ““I know very well what you were planning to say,” said Draco with an apologetic frown. “It’s just…I can’t and I won’t compromise your health for my own selfish reasons.”“It’s not just you, Draco,” Harry said quietly.“You don’t know that,” he said just as softly. “You’re still adjusting to – to everything and the feelings you have might not be real. And I know I’m not your Healer anymore, but it was only a few weeks ago that I had power and authority over you, and the power balance is still…”“It’s not,” said Harry stubbornly.“I’m sorry, Harry,” said Draco, “But this is something I won’t change my mind about.”Harry let out a sharp sigh and studied Draco. His expression was serious, but his eyes were soft, making Harry feel just a little bit better.“Fine, I’ll stop bringing it up,” Harry said, and Draco relaxed. And then, only half-joking, he warned, “But you better mark your calendar, Malfoy, because as soon as my year is up, I’ll be sending you an owl.”Draco laughed lightly, picking his glass up to take a sip.“I look forward to it, Potter.”From the moment Harry had woken up, he’d felt awful.No, not awful. There wasn’t a word good enough to encapsulate just how terrible he felt. His entire body hurt as if he’d been run over by a hoard of hippogriffs, even though he hadn’t done anything out of the ordinary yesterday. His mind felt heavy, bogged down, already worn out even though he’d barely started his day.He knew, of course, the reason for feeling so poorly. It’d been looming over his head the past week, tormenting and taunting him from the back of his mind. And the past few nights, he’d been having nightmares about it, the same exact scene playing over and over again.It was October 31st.When Harry trudged into the kitchen to pour himself a cup of coffee, Ginny was already sat at the island in the middle of it. She watched him make a cup for himself, using the coffee Ginny had already brewed however long ago. He went to sit down across from her.“You’re up early,” he commented.“So are you,” Ginny countered.“Yeah, well,” Harry said, taking a sip. “Couldn’t sleep.”“You want to talk about it?”“Not really.”“What would you like to do?”Harry shrugged. He rubbed at his eyes from underneath his glasses and looked at Ginny, his mind blank.“Let’s see what’s on,” he said finally, and started for the living room without waiting for her.They were still watching The X-Files when the sun began to go down and both Harry’s and Ginny’s stomachs started grumbling.“Do we have any food in the house?” asked Ginny warily, already knowing the answer.“No,” Harry said. “We have crisps, and erm…tea.”“I knew we should’ve gone shopping yesterday,” Ginny grumbling, getting up from her spot on the floor. She looked down at Harry, her hands on her hips. “D’you want take-out? I can go pick up.”Over the past month that she’d been living with him, Harry had taught Ginny how to order take-out from small Muggle restaurants. She had become quite proficient at it already, though it still took her a bit longer than normal to count out the change.Harry nodded. “Yeah, that’d be great.”“You want to come? Or you can stay here,” Ginny offered.Harry considered this for a moment before firmly deciding that no, he felt way too poorly to go outside. He told Ginny this, and she nodded understandably. She pulled on her coat, told him that she’d be back in about thirty minutes, and was gone.Now, surrounded only by waning daylight, his empty room, and the soft sounds of Mulder and Scully in the background, Harry was left alone with his thoughts.He groaned, leaned back against the couch, and closed his eyes.“Fuck,” he said to the air.Halloween always brought a flurry of emotions and thoughts with it, threatening to drown Harry with endless questions that could never be answered. What if they had never been killed that night? What if the prophecy never existed? What if Harry had just been a normal fucking kid with parents who were alive and loved him?Would they be proud of him if they knew him today? Or would they, perhaps, be disgusted by what he’d become? Wonder how this could’ve happened to their only son?Harry opened his eyes and raked a trembling hand through his hair. Barely aware of what he was doing, he stood and walked into his bedroom. Stopping by his bedside table, his hands searched automatically for the photo album Hagrid had given him so many years ago. It was buried at the bottom of the drawer.He flipped it open to his favorite picture of his parents – the one of them dancing. Harry stared hard at it, blinking back tears, and studied it for the thousandth time. They’d been so young, so fucking young, and there was Harry, twenty-five and wasting the life his mother had sacrificed herself for.God, he needed something, anything to help him not feel this way. So utterly useless, hopeless, pathetic, and fucking miserable.And then something occurred to him: Ginny was gone. She wasn’t here. Harry had his wand, his money, and…He stood up shakily, grabbed his wand, and thought about the address of a residence he hadn’t been to in a good while. Harry spun into darkness and reemerged on a Muggle street, which was thankfully empty. He stowed his wand, distractedly chastising himself for being so careless, and hurried over to a small, familiar house.As he came up the steps, the door opened and a man came outside, a curious look on his face. As his eyes adjusted in the dark, he squinted at Harry and stepped forward.“Harry? Is that you?”“Yeah,” said Harry, coming to stand in front of Johnny.“Blimey!” he said, then peered over Harry’s shoulder. “I just came out here cos I heard a car backfiring or something, but – wow! Come in, come in. It’s been ages.”“Yeah,” Harry said again, and followed Johnny into his house.As soon as Harry had stepped foot in it, he was assaulted by countless memories of being in the house and the strong smell of weed. He inhaled shakily and stuck his hands in his pockets. Apparently oblivious to Harry’s discomfort, Johnny flopped down into his armchair and gestured toward the empty sofa beside it.“Siddown, mate,” Johnny said. When Harry did, he continued, “How long’s it been, Harry? A month? You haven’t answered any calls.”“Yeah, sorry. Something came up,” said Harry dismissively, wanting to leave as soon as possible and get back home before Ginny did. “Look, Johnny, I was just wondering if you had any benzos.”Thankfully, Johnny said nothing more of Harry’s abrupt disappearance and began rummaging around on his filthy table. “Sure, yeah. Just got a new shipment of Xanax today, actually. How much?”Harry relaxed instantly, letting out a sigh of relief. “Just – just two. Are they one milligram?”Johnny nodded and produced a plastic Ziplock bag of small, pale pills.“Just two? You sure, mate?”“Maybe four. How much?”“Six quid for you,” said Johnny. He shook out four of the pills and transferred them to a smaller bag.Harry took the bag gratefully and pocketed it, his heart pounding just at the sight of them. He passed the money over to him.“Thank you, Johnny. I really owe you.”“Nah,” Johnny said, smiling. “Just answer your phone more often, alright?”Harry nodded, though Ginny had broken Harry’s old phone and recruited Hermione’s help to buy him a new one his first day out of St. Mungo’s.“I’ll see you later,” Harry said, already standing and making his way to Johnny’s front door. “Have a good night, Johnny.”“Yeah, you too, Harry.”Once Harry had shut the door closed behind him, he walked over to a more secluded area, already withdrawing the little bag out of his pocket. Once he was satisfied he wouldn’t be seen, he opened the bag up. His hands shook as he took out two of the little pills.Harry shoved them in his mouth before he could talk himself out of it, dry-swallowed, put the bag back into the pocket of his jeans, and Apparated back home.He looked around as soon as he had materialized back in the flat, his heart thudding as he did so. Once he was satisfied Ginny hadn’t come home yet, he began looking for a good hiding spot.God, why did he buy four? Two would’ve been sufficient; he wouldn’t be needing anymore after today. But still, as he ran his fingers over the small lump in his jeans, he felt a calm that he hadn’t felt in what seemed like ages. Finally, Harry decided on the Moleskin pouch he’d gotten from Hagrid around eight years ago. It was failsafe, really – only the owner could open it.Satisfied and already starting to feel the effects of the Xanax, Harry went back into the living room and sat back down in his spot on the couch. He’d only been half-watching the telly for five minutes when Ginny came through the front door, bringing in the aroma of cheese and marinara sauce with her.“I got pizza, I hope that’s alright,” Ginny said with a grin.She set the two large boxes down on the coffee table in front of the couch and shrugged off her coat, tossing it on the couch.“Brilliant, thanks,” said Harry, already reaching to open one of the boxes.He picked up a slice of pepperoni and tried to make it seem like he wasn’t concentrating too hard on doing so. Even so, he could feel Ginny watching him as he took a bite, so he looked over at her after he’d finished swallowing.“What?” Harry asked, his heart in his throat. Had she already figured it out? She couldn’t have. It wasn’t like he was drooling or anything, and he wasn’t too tired yet.“How are you feeling?Harry nearly sighed in relief. “I’m fine, Gin.”“You sure? Do you want to talk about it?” she asked him, brown eyes big and sincere.“No, I’m fine,” Harry told her again, guilt blooming inside of him. He focused on maintaining eye contact with Ginny, who still seemed skeptical. “Really.”She frowned at him. “Well, if you change your mind, I’ll be here.”“I know. Thanks, Ginny.”The guilt was short-lived and lessened as time went on; they sat and ate in silence as they watched two more hours of reruns. It really wasn’t that big of a deal, Harry rationalized; it wasn’t like he was going on a bender or like he’d dropped hundreds of pounds on hard drugs. It was just Muggle prescription medication – they took it all the time!Yes, Harry thought drowsily, it was alright. Just this once. And besides, he had a good enough reason, didn’t he? Harry wondered if anyone who’d ever told themselves ‘just this once’ had actually done it just the once.He’d taken the other two pills the next day while Ginny was in the shower. The day after that, he dutifully went to see Wolff, pretended everything was Going Great, and made a stop at Johnny’s to smoke a spliff with him before heading back home.Harry had immediately gone for the shower and put on a change of clothes, not knowing if Ginny even knew what weed smelled like but also not wanting to take any chances. When he had emerged from the bathroom, hair wet and heart pounding, Ginny frowned at him.“Are you alright?” she had asked, coming closer.“Huh? Yeah, why?” he asked, panic washing over him and disturbing what had been a pleasant high.“Nothing – your eyes are just a bit red,” she commented, cocking her head and giving him a sad smile. “Good session today?”“Er, yeah,” Harry said quickly, thankful for the excuse. “I’m fine, though, promise.”“It’ll get easier,” Ginny had said before patting his shoulder and walking away.Dazed, he escaped into his room, telling himself he wouldn’t come out until the high wore off.Harry was able to keep the ruse going for another week and a half before it all went to shit.As the days went on, he had to resort to riskier tactics to continue to get drugs every few days. He didn’t even bother with potions; that would involve the use of glamors and would altogether be too dangerous. In the Muggle world, he was no one – just another bloke who wanted to escape reality for a bit.It was on a Thursday evening that he’d gotten back from Johnny’s (telling Ginny he was headed for the shop) tipsy and high. It was the first time Harry had drunk alcohol since waking up in St. Mungo’s and it was fucking glorious. As he set down his “groceries,” he thought that he’d like to feel like this forever.“Harry? Is that you?”Ginny came into the kitchen as Harry bent back up, his heart rate increasing monumentally. Merlin, he really didn’t have enough mental power to deal with this right now. He forced himself to focus on what she’d said.“Yeah, sorry, just got back,” he said as normally as he could manage.“You were gone for a while.”“I walked.”Ginny raised an eyebrow but didn’t say anything else. She walked closer and peered into the bag.“You didn’t get any proper food?” she asked, drawing up to her full height and looking at Harry strangely.Harry ran a hand through his air and looked away, wincing internally. He’d been so focused on getting salty snacks that he’d completely forgotten that Ginny had asked for things with nutritional value, like vegetables.“Sorry,” he said weakly. “I forgot.”“Vegetables, Harry!” she said, throwing up her arms. “That’s all I asked for! You were out for a full hour and couldn’t remember the one thing I’d asked you to get?”“I, er, yeah.”Ginny’s arms fell and she narrowed her eyes at him. “Are you feeling alright, Harry?”“Yeah, fine,” he said. If fucking vegetables were going to be his downfall, he was going to off himself. Harry brushed past Ginny and made for his room, avoiding eye contact. “I’m just tired.”“What’s that smell?”Harry froze immediately, a cold sweat quickly developing at the back of his neck. He turned slowly as a steady stream of curses cut through his foggy mind.“What smell?”“It’s –” Ginny wrinkled her nose. “I dunno. It’s strange.”She stepped closer, and Harry would’ve liked nothing more than to turn and run into his room. He was frozen in place, however, his fear effectively petrifying him.“It’s coming from you, I think,” Ginny said slowly. Her brown eyes met his, and Harry’s mouth went dry. “Harry…”He swallowed thickly, wet his lips.“Yeah?”“Is it…did you…?”“Did I what?” he tried to ask guilelessly, but it sounded wrong even to his ears.Ginny’s face went from suspicious to scared to angry in a matter of seconds, her eyes wide and mouth open.“Harry,” she said again, low and dangerous.“I – “Her eyes seemed to be burning, and her pale hands were clenched into fists at her sides.“You did, didn’t you?” Ginny asked, her voice cracking a bit. “You fucking used, didn’t you, Harry?”“It was only – I mean – “He backed away on instinct, his hands coming up to defend himself. Ginny was still coming towards him, though, and with a panic Harry realized that she had her wand in her hand.“Ginny, please – ““You went behind my back. You took advantage of my trust,” Ginny said, backing him into a wall. He hit it with a thud and shook his head desperately, trying to deny it all. She cut him off before he could even start, however, snapping, “Don’t lie to me, Harry. I can fucking smell the liquor on your breath.”Harry clamped his mouth shut and looked away, his eyes burning. He was ashamed of himself, for getting himself in this situation again for the thousandth time for having to see Ginny like this to know he made Ginny feel this way to know he’d fucked up again –Ginny cried out in frustration, bringing her hands up to her face, wand still clenched in one of them, and pulled back from Harry.He gave a shuddering breath and slid down the wall into a pathetic heap on the ground. Harry drew his legs up to his chest, took his glasses off aggressively, set them aside, and burrowed his face in his arms, unshed tears dampening his shirtsleeves.Harry wasn’t sure how long he’d been in that position, trying to hold back sobs, before he heard muffled footsteps stalking away. When he did, though, there was no use in attempting to stem the tears. He let out a choked sob as he pictured Ginny walking away, leaving Harry (like she should, like he deserved). He hated himself, hated what he’d done, what he’d become, and how he couldn’t just fucking stop.His shirtsleeves were soaked by the time he heard footsteps coming into the room again.“Harry.”He didn’t move.“Harry,” Ginny said again, softer this time. She touched his arm hesitantly, and Harry thought he felt someone else’s presence in the room. “I’ve – I’ve brought someone.”Panic flooded him; who could Ginny have brought? Ron? Or Hermione? Or maybe –Harry’s head snapped up, his vision blurry without glasses. Still, he didn’t need them to know that Draco Malfoy stood several feet behind Ginny, who was kneeling beside Harry.“I’m going to…I’ll just be…”She didn’t finish either of her sentences before withdrawing her hand and standing up. Harry dimly watched Ginny leave the room and recognized the distant whoosh of the Floo going.“Po – Harry,” came Malfoy’s voice, and Harry shuddered.“I’d rather you leave too,” Harry bit out, wiping the wetness away from his face with the heel of his palm. He’d turned his head to the side, not wanting to see Malfoy, or for Malfoy to see him. Still, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw Malfoy come closer. Harry closed them. “Please, Malfoy. Just go.”“I’m going to sit down next to you,” Malfoy said quietly in his Healer voice. “Alright?”Harry would’ve liked to argue, but he didn’t think he had the ability to do so. He could barely speak as it was, too terrified that he would begin crying all over again, which was a mortifying thought.He opened his eyes and blinked at Malfoy, who was now sitting on the floor with him, looking strange and out-of-place in his lime green robes and in Harry’s flat. Malfoy was staring at him, grey eyes intense as they regarded Harry carefully.“What made you want to use again, Harry?”Harry bit his lip and focused on the ground instead of on Malfoy’s tense face. A headache was beginning to form and he would’ve liked nothing more than to lay down in his bed, but he stayed where he was.“I started again on Halloween,” Harry admitted quietly. Malfoy was silent, and Harry glanced up at him. Bitterly, he said, “I’m sure you know enough Potter trivia to understand that.”Malfoy disregarded this. “Why didn’t you talk to Ginevra? Or owl Wolff?”“It wouldn’t have helped,” Harry answered shortly. “I know what helps by now, Malfoy. I wasn’t supposed to keep using at first, and I know it was stupid of me to think I really wouldn’t, but, well. So here we are. Back where I started.”“That’s not true,” Malfoy said sharply. “You’ve still made a lot of progress, and one relapse doesn’t erase all that.”“One?” Harry laughed humorlessly.“Since leaving treatment a little over a month ago,” Malfoy clarified. “It’s fairly common for patients to relapse shortly after being discharged from treatment, and it certainly doesn’t mean the end of recovery, or that you’ve ‘failed’ at it.”Harry still felt like a massive failure despite Malfoy’s words, but he didn’t tell him this. Malfoy’s eyes were sad now, and it tugged painfully at Harry’s heart. Brilliant, he thought, another person I get to inevitably disappoint.He tore his gaze away from Malfoy and looked around for his glasses instead. His brain still wasn’t working as fast as he would’ve liked, and he didn’t think he’d be fully sober for another hour at the least. As he put his glasses back on, he searched for something to say.“Make house calls often, do you?” Harry asked, finally making eye contact with Malfoy again.Malfoy smiled slightly and said, “Only in extenuating circumstances.”“Hope I didn’t interrupt any important Healer work,” Harry mumbled.“No, just paperwork. Would you mind if I asked what substances you’re currently on?”“Just weed and vodka,” Harry answered, then frowned. “Mostly just have a headache right now, though.”“You’re most likely dehydrated. Shall I get you a glass of water?”Harry nodded.“That’d be nice.”He watched as Malfoy stood up gracefully and made for the kitchen. Harry sat there for a few more seconds before standing as well.When he walked into the kitchen, he saw Malfoy at the sink, pouring water into one of Harry’s glasses. It was unbelievable just how breathtaking the sight was, because it really was just Malfoy in his crisp, white button-up and (fairly) tight black trousers standing in Harry’s kitchen.He was suddenly struck by the absurd thought of this perhaps being a normal, regular thing – Draco getting a drink for Harry in his kitchen, leaning against the counter and looking effortlessly gorgeous. Harry wanted to see this sight every day, he wanted it to be commonplace and simply a part of his life –  “You alright?”Draco’s voice cut through Harry’s bizarre line of thought; Harry blinked at him before nodding.“Yeah, fine,” Harry said weakly, sinking down into a chair.Draco frowned at him, then handed him the water.Harry guzzled it down, not having realized just how thirsty he was, the cool water soothing his parched throat. He saw Draco hesitating in front of him, and Harry set the glass down on the table, now half-empty.“You can sit down, Malfoy.”“Thank you,” he said quietly, and sat. “I hope it’s alright that I hung my robes up.”“Yeah, course.”Draco hanging his Healers robes on Harry’s coat hanger was truly the least of his worries right now.“How are you feeling now?”“Calmer,” Harry said truthfully. He stared at the water droplets on his glass as he spoke. “I’m just…embarrassed, mostly. I hate hurting Ginny like that, just knowing I’ve done that, making her so upset, it’s...”Draco nodded. “Might it even make you think that the temporary relief wasn’t worth it?”“I know it’s not worth it. I’d take it back if I could. I’d take it all back,” Harry said, his throat thick. “I never would’ve started – started any of this if I knew where it’d take me.”He took a deep, shuddering breath, really not wanting to start crying again, especially with Draco right in front of him, and then he felt a hand on his own. Harry looked up, startled, and locked eyes with Draco, whose pale face was set in determination. Harry barely dared to breathe as he slowly interlocked his fingers with Draco’s. Expecting to be slapped away, he was surprised when Draco tightened his own grip.Draco’s eyes were wide but he seemed adamant, mouth set in a stubborn line.Harry nearly let out a startled laugh but kept his mouth shut, not wanting to scare Draco off. He was dazed, his already hazy mind spinning with this unexpected turn of events. What did this mean? Why wasn’t Draco pushing him away? Had they ever touched like this before? Was the last time they’d touched in the Room of Requirement, surrounded by cursed flames and Draco’s panicked breathing on his neck and his hands gripping Harry so tightly it hurt?A loud noise came from the living room and both Harry and Draco jumped and snatched their hands back. Harry could only glance at Draco’s alarmed face for a second before he was jumped on by Hermione and Ron.“Harry, how could you – “ Hermione was already saying as she came into the kitchen, obviously distressed. She hurried over to him and searched his face, concern marring her features. “Are you alright? Oh, Harry, I don’t know what to say, when Ginny firecalled I – ”“Is he alright, Malfoy?” asked Ron gruffly from behind Harry. “Physically?”Harry saw Draco nod jerkily, and then felt something hit the side of his head.“Weasley!”“Ron!”“Oi!” Harry exclaimed, his voice nearly drowned out by Draco’s and Hermione’s own. He swiveled in his seat to glare at Ron, who didn’t look apologetic in the slightest. “You didn’t have to hit me!”“Yeah I did,” said Ron. He watched Harry rub the affected area without remorse. “Bloody prat.”Draco cleared his throat. “I’ll have to ask you not to speak to my patient that way, Weasley.”“He’s not your patient anymore,” Ron countered.“Still, I can’t just stand by –““Oh, Harry, I was so worried – ““He’s fine, Malfoy.”“ – Ginny was in such a state – “All the commotion was intensifying Harry’s headache and making it even harder to think straight.“Please shut up,” Harry said loudly, causing the three of them to stop talking and look at him with varying degrees of indignation. “I deserved that, alright? Thanks for the concern, Draco, and Ron, I’m still annoyed at you. And I’m fine, Hermione, I just feel like a right idiot. Where’s Ginny?”“I’m still annoyed at you too,” Ron said stubbornly. “She’s fine, she’s at the Burrow.”Harry breathed a sigh of relief. He rubbed at his forehead and asked, “How much does she hate me?”“She doesn’t hate you, Harry,” Hermione started to say, but then Ron said, “Not as much as she should.”“Right. Should I, er, go and talk to her?”Ron eyed him distrustfully. “Mum’s home, too.”Harry deflated. He couldn’t face Mrs. Weasley, not yet.“Maybe…maybe in a bit.”Hermione began chastising Ron for treating Harry so roughly, and Harry took the opportunity to slip away, giving the feeble excuse of needing to use the loo. When he’d gotten to the hallway leading to the bathroom and his bedroom, he saw that Draco had followed him.They stood in the dim hallway and looked at each other.“Draco, I…” Harry began, running a hand through his hair. He was nervous all over again, remembering the moment they’d had before Hermione and Ron had arrived and wanting to know what it meant. “Do you…”The light that was spilling in from the living room was accentuating one side of Draco’s face, emphasizing his sharp cheekbones and thin nose. His eyebrows were drawn together and even in the darkness, Harry could tell that he was looking guiltily at Harry. His heart dropped.“I think I should…perhaps keep my distance from now on, Harry,” Draco began to say, and no no no no no began to run through Harry’s mind, his fear confirmed. “It’s too – I shouldn’t have let you do that in the kitchen, it wasn’t right. You’re meant to focus on recovery, and I think I may be distracting you and that’s the last thing I want. This is too important and I can’t compromise it – your health, your life.“The Muggles have a term for it, did you know? The Florence Nightingale Effect. It’s when patients think they’ve developed romantic feelings for their caretaker, given their vulnerable state and gratitude towards the caretaker. But it’s not real, Harry.”“It is.”“Even if it were, you need a year to focus on yourself. Solely yourself. And my presence is just getting in the way of that.”He looked at Harry sorrowfully, and Harry wanted to hit him. He couldn’t speak, couldn’t find the words, and when Draco made to leave, he softly said, “If you were serious about that owl, I’ll be looking forward to it,” and all Harry could do was stare blankly at his retreating back.




Notes:

Relapse rates for drug use are similar to rates for other chronic medical illnesses. If people stop following their medical treatment plan, they are likely to relapse...Treatment of chronic diseases involves changing deeply rooted behaviors, and relapse doesn’t mean treatment has failed.

PART TWO 

CHAPTER FIFTEEN
It’d started off a normal day.Draco had woken up, taken a shower, and eaten breakfast before Flooing to work. He’d looked over paperwork that had come in overnight and made his rounds. He spoke to Leo, about both work and personal matters. They were doing well again, having put the past behind them. Leo had stopped making advances, finally resigned to the fact that Draco really was over him. He chatted with Betty, now a full-fledged Healer. She’d passed her exams with flying colors and was doing extremely well, somehow now more determined than ever. And he had coffee with Ira, who still managed to fit time in their busy schedule to listen to Draco’s many lamentations, big and small.In fact, it was normal up until the point he’d gotten back home.Stumbling tiredly out of his fireplace, he was surprised to meet the wide, yellow eyes of a strange owl through Draco’s living room window. Bemused, Draco went over to open the window and let the owl in. The owl hooted contemptuously as it hopped inside and stuck its leg out.Draco untied the small scroll, but before he could even say something, the owl was gone. Frowning, Draco pulled the window shut and sat down in his armchair. When he’d unrolled the parchment, he had to blink and rub his eyes to make sure he wasn’t seeing things.But no, scrawled carefully on the parchment was the following;

It’s been a year. Here’s my owl.

Harry
“Oh,” said Draco, and read it again.He put the letter down on his coffee table, stood up quickly, and promptly began pacing nervously around his flat.What should he do? It definitely had been a year since he’d discharged Potter from St. Mungo’s, and perhaps eleven months since he’d last seen him. He hadn’t realized it, but it was true.It wasn’t like he’d forgotten about Potter completely (that would, quite frankly, be impossible), and Potter had forced his way into Draco’s mind a few times over the past eleven months.Potter had, surprisingly enough, entered the public eye again. His sudden reappearance after over five years of nothing had nearly given the entirety of the Wizarding world a heart attack. Draco still remembered the Prophet’s article about it – THE SAVIOR’S RETURN – accompanied by a photograph of Potter, Granger, and Weasley walking through Diagon Alley. He’d felt a pang of hurt as he looked at it, though he quickly dismissed it. It was Draco’s choice, after all, to distance himself from Potter and consequently their mutual friends.He still thought it was the right one, mind, his belief only reaffirmed when there’d been a photograph published by the Prophet of Potter with his skin glowing and flashing a smile at the camera. He seemed well; young and healthy like he had looked for a few brief months around ’99 or so.Draco stalked around his flat in search of a week-old Prophet that he hadn’t gotten around to binning yet; if he remembered correctly, there was a mention of Potter in it…He found it underneath an old mug of coffee, slightly stained and crumpled. Draco withdrew the newspaper and flipped through it until he’d located the article he had only skimmed through before. HARRY POTTER’S GENEROUS DONATION, screamed the title. Below it was a photograph of Potter shaking hands with a pretty witch in her thirty’s, and a short article detailing how Potter had donated an impressive sum to a small, national organization called the Magical Centre for Mental Health.Draco felt a rush of pride as he read the article more carefully, amazed at how far Potter had come. He stared at the photograph for a couple more moments before hurrying to find a clean piece of parchment and quill. “Aright, what is it?”“Hmm?”Draco’s mind was pulled away from Potter at Leo’s irritated voice. He looked at Leo expectantly, and Leo looked at him right back.“That’s the third time you’ve checked your watch since I’ve walked in here,” Leo said impatiently, “And that was only five minutes ago. What is it? Am I boring you?”Draco closed his eyes and rubbed at his forehead.“No, of course not, Leo,” Draco said finally, frowning at him. “I apologize, please continue.”“Nah, I’m not gonna bother,” Leo said, and he flopped down into the chair opposite Draco’s. “I’ll just leave a report on your desk by the end of the day. Will you tell me what’s up?”“’What’s up’ is that I’m still your superior, Leo, and I can’t allow you to speak to me that way,” Draco told him with no real anger.Leo only grinned cockily. “You’ll still let me though. So tell me, what is it? Hot date tonight?”“No,” Draco said quickly, and Leo’s grin only grew. The bastard. “I’m just…supposed to be meeting someone.”He checked his watch again as he spoke; if he left in six minutes, he would have fifteen to get ready, and five to get to the restaurant. He wondered what he would wear; he’d never been to the restaurant Potter had suggested, and he didn’t want to appear underdressed…Muggle clothing was the obvious choice, but what, exactly…“Hey!”Draco started and looked guiltily at Leo, who was scowling.“You did it again,” he said. “So who’s this ‘someone’? Must be pretty important if they’ve been distracting you this much.”“No one,” Draco said hurriedly. “And he’s not,” he added for good measure.“Draco,” said Leo in a long-suffering way, “You’re not fooling anyone.”Draco knew this, but he didn’t want to admit it. Still, he sighed and avoided looking right at Leo.“Fine. If you must know, it’s…Potter.”Leo’s eyes widened. “Really?”“Yes. He Owled me on Tuesday and we made plans to have dinner together in,” Draco checked his watch, “Twenty-four minutes.”“Wait, is this the first you’ve heard from him since, what, last year?”Draco nodded, his anxiety tightening its hold on his heart.“Wow,” Leo said helpfully.“Yeah,” Draco breathed out shakily. “Wow.”Leo examined him closely.“Are you nervous? Oh, come on, you’ve faced much bigger problems than dinner with Harry Potter,” he said, rolling his eyes.Draco would never get over the way Leo said ‘Potter’; it was so appallingly American. He had to laugh.“Yeah, I suppose,” Draco said, feeling marginally better.“You got this, boss. Don’t worry about it.”Don’t worry about it, his arse.Draco’s heart was beating erratically as he smoothed his hair down for the thousandth time since arriving outside the restaurant. When was Potter going to get here? Sure, Draco was early, but would it kill Potter to not be late for – for this?He took a deep breath. No, he was not going to get into a snit for such a trivial thing. He just had to relax.“Malfoy.”Shivers ran down Draco’s entire body at the sound of Potter’s voice, and he hoped he didn’t look as shaken as he felt as he turned to look at the other man.Merlin, Potter looked good. The photographs in the paper had hinted at the fact that he’d looked better, but it was nothing compared to seeing him in person. Potter’s skin had a healthy glow to it – he no longer looked so sickly, and though he still bore a beard, it was neat and complemented his face rather than distracted from it. He could admittedly still stand to gain a few pounds, but his form was still a far cry from what he’d looked like a year ago, haggard and wasted.Draco hoped and prayed that his surprise (and delight) wasn’t too obvious on his face, but he knew very well that he was flushing given the way his temperature had suddenly gone up at least ten degrees.“Potter,” he managed in a tight voice.Potter – Harry? gave him a little smile and stuck his hands in his jeans pockets.“It’s good to see you.”“And you as well. You look…well,” Draco finished feebly, his face positively on fire.“Thanks, Malfoy.” Harry grinned in a pleased way. “So do you.”“Let’s go in, shall we?” Draco offered when they’d stood there for a few more moments, the two of them obviously having no clue what to say next.“Yeah,” Harry said, clearly relieved. He led the way, opening the door and letting Draco pass through. “After you.”Draco fought the smile that threatened to burst from his face and chastised himself – what was he, a third year? He distractedly watched Harry give the hostess his name and followed as she led them to their table. They sat down, and the hostess left.“This is nice,” Draco said, looking around. “Have you been here before?”Harry nodded. “A few times.” He glanced around the restaurant too, tapping his fingers on the table. “Ron and Hermione introduced me to it.”“Ah,” said Draco guiltily. “And how are they?”Harry turned his attention back to Draco and smiled at him wryly. “They’re good. Finally married.”“Oh – yes, I think I saw something in the paper,” Draco said truthfully, but he had admittedly forgotten all about it. He made a mental note to send them a congratulatory note and gift as soon as possible. “Give my regards to the happy couple.”“Yeah, sure,” Harry said. “Though I hope you’ll tell them in person soon. It’s been a while since anyone’s seen you. Ginny and Zabini are back, you know.”Draco nodded.“I know. Blaise sent me an Owl last week…”He trailed off as a waitress approached them. After she’d introduced herself and taken their drink orders (water for Harry, decaffeinated coffee for Draco), she left and they were alone once again.“I’ve been a bit caught up in work,” Draco said, and it wasn’t a lie. He paused. “It would be nice to see everyone again.”“Yeah, and now you can since you’re allowed to be near me again.”Draco colored at this, and though Harry didn’t look angry, Draco was certain that Harry was teasing him.“I don’t regret that,” Draco said firmly, tilting his chin up defensively. “It was the right choice. I can see that now – I meant what I said earlier, Harry; you look well.”His use of Harry’s given name seemed to startle them both, and Draco recovered first.“I’m sorry, I –“ Draco broke off, looking down and pulling nervously at the edges of his long sleeves. He didn’t like how difficult speaking to Harry was; it’d actually been relatively easy for a moment there. But now…“It’s strange.”Harry studied him with soft eyes, his green eyes looking darker in the dim lighting.“Yeah, it is,” he said quietly.The waitress came with their drinks and took their orders. She bustled off again and Harry leaned closer over the table.“It doesn’t have to be, I don’t think,” he said carefully. “I mean, we actually got on alright, didn’t we? For a bit? Until I, er, buggered it all up.”“You didn’t,” Draco said sharply.“I did,” Harry said, seeming amused by Draco’s quick defense of him. “You were right, even though I didn’t know it at the time. I wasn’t ready for a relationship – or for anything, really, but I was convinced that I was. And you were nice enough to let me down gently every time I tried something.”“I, well,” said Draco, embarrassed, “I don’t know about gently.”“It was. You were,” Harry said earnestly. Draco’s insides felt light and airy, and he didn’t have the heart to stamp those feelings down. “Well, maybe not the last time. I was gutted, if I’m being honest, Ma– Draco, but er…I don’t think I’d be where I am right now if you hadn’t done that.”“Even if that were true,” said Draco carefully, “You owe your success to yourself. No one else did that, Harry, it was all you. It could only have been you. Don’t sell yourself short.”“Oh. Well. I still had loads of help,” said Harry, clearly uncomfortable.“You had the final say – still do. Doesn’t really matter what anyone else does.”“Yeah, alright, Healer Malfoy,” Harry teased, smirking just a bit. His eyes were flashing in the light and he seemed so youthful, so full of life – Draco wanted Harry to look at him like that forever. “Not here for a lecture, you know.”“What are you here for, then, if not for that?” Draco asked.Harry leaned close again, his full lips still pulled into a smirk. “I dunno, Malfoy. Maybe I’m still figuring it out.”Draco felt a shiver run down his spine at Harry’s low, husky voice and glanced away, fearing Harry would be able to see the flush on his cheeks. Fuck. If Harry was planning on keeping this up all throughout dinner, he didn’t know if he could survive. It’d been ages since he’d been shagged – the last time having been Leo – and he was already feeling antsy.“And what about you? Why are you here?”Draco met Harry’s gaze again and rolled his eyes at the other man’s cocky grin.“Because you invited me, or don’t you remember?”Harry tsked and leaned back. He crossed his arms.“Alright, then, how about an easier question if you can’t answer the other. Are you seeing anyone?”Draco shook his head no.“How interesting,” said Harry. “Neither am I.”Draco had to refrain from rolling his eyes once again – where’d Harry even learn these awful lines? – and instead took a disinterested sip of his decaf.“Look, not to put my Healer hat on again but do you know what you’re getting yourself into?” Draco asked critically. Harry sat up straighter, rising to the bait. “Is this what you really want? Are you wholly prepared for a new relationship? Because that’s what you’ll be getting if you continue heading down this road. I’m not really one for a quick fuck.”He received a visceral reaction from Harry at those last two words; a startled blink of the eyes and a quick, sharp breath in. Draco relaxed in his chair, satisfied.“Neither am I,” Harry repeated, though his voice was much huskier than it had been. He licked his lips and swallowed, Draco watched his Adam’s apple move as he did so. “God, Draco, you don’t know how much I want you. It’s driving me mental.”Draco thought he had an idea; it was probably similar to how much he wanted Harry.Slowly, he said, “We have to do this right. If anything happens – anything – I’ll never forgive myself.”Harry’s expression darkened instantly. “Nothing will. I’m doing good, and I have been for a while now. You wouldn’t know, of course, but it’s true. Now stop being melodramatic and just fucking say yes, Draco. I know you want to.”The passion in Harry’s eyes, his face, his voice was startling, mainly because it’d been so long since Draco had seen it. It was an almost everyday occurrence back at Hogwarts, him getting fired up about something, anything. It made Draco sick to his stomach – how could someone possibly care that much – but now, knowing he was the cause of it, he had lit this particular fire…“I do,” said Draco lowly. “But I can’t stop worrying about if something did happen, if I was the cause of you relapsing just because I’d been selfish –““Jesus,” interrupted Harry impatiently. “Aren’t you tired of this? The same argument, over and over again? It’s been a year. I’m clean. I haven’t used since – since that day, and even though some days are fucking hell, I’m not planning on using again. I’m not fragile, Draco. I’m not about to break.”“You’re anything but,” Draco agreed, though this didn’t do much to assuage Harry. He sighed. “You really don’t feel that we’d be moving too fast?”Harry stared blankly at him before hissing, “I waited a year for you.”“Yes, a year of absolutely no contact. And then one dinner and suddenly a relationship? I want to do this right, Harry.”Draco looked at Harry, who was chewing his bottom lip just a touch too aggressively. But he was quiet and thinking over Draco’s words instead of immediately refuting them, which was progress.“Fine,” said Harry sharply after another minute of silence. “We’ll do it right, then. Go on dates, wine and dine, ease into it. Is that what you want?”“Yes,” Draco said. “I’d feel much better about it that way.”“Anything for you, you prat.”Though his tone was sharp and he’d made a face as he said it, Harry’s words somehow sounded sincere, much more than they should had. Draco frowned a bit, but before he could respond, their waitress approached and set their food down in front of them. Harry thanked her and she walked away, and Draco was still oddly touched by what Harry had said earlier.Harry, however, seemed completely unconcerned and had already started on his plate. When he noticed Draco wasn’t eating, however, he stopped chewing and poked his fork towards Draco’s own plate of food.“What’s wrong? You aren’t eating.”“Oh. Yes,” said Draco and hurriedly picked up his fork. “Sorry.”Harry’s brows furrowed together but he said nothing.

Chapter Text
Harry was one hundred percent convinced that Draco Malfoy worried too much for his own good. He probably even thought much more than he needed to. Like when he sat and stared at nothing while their food arrived, and how he didn’t snap out of it until Harry said something.He sometimes wondered what Draco was thinking about so intensely. It was hard to tell, but Harry had to assume it was about him. Sometimes Harry just wanted to grab Draco by the shoulders and shake him, perhaps yell that he was certain about wanting to start a relationship with him and to stop bloody worrying for once. But, alas, he didn’t know how Draco would react to that and he wasn’t too keen on finding out.Draco’s resistance to him was unnerving to Harry. Sure, he’d said he was interested in Harry, but words only meant so much. What Harry wanted was action.God, Draco was so unbelievably beautiful. All sharp lines, pursed lips, and calculating grey eyes, it was a wonder Harry hadn’t jumped him already. And the bastard knew Harry was aching for him and did nothing but fight him on it.The rest of their dinner went relatively normally; Harry asked Draco about work, and Draco asked Harry the same (or the closest thing Harry had to it, anyway). The way Draco asked made Harry think he might have been following the press surrounding him, but Harry said nothing about it. He simply told Draco about how he’d joined a few wizarding organizations that focused on mental health awareness and potion addiction. He rarely liked using his fame to his advantage, but this was for a good cause – and one that was close to him as well. And besides, it’s not like he had anything better to do.When their food was gone and their conversation had waned, Harry asked their waitress for the check. Draco made to pay, but Harry took care of it before he had the chance.“I invited you out, remember?”“Fair enough.”They left the restaurant shortly after and hovered outside the door, looking at each other uncertainly. Harry’s heart hammered a distracting beat as he tried to think of what to say, a difficult feat with the way Draco was watching him.“So,” Harry said, clearing his throat, “We’re really doing this then? The whole, er, dating thing?”“I suppose so,” Draco answered with an amused smile on his face. “You finally wore me down.”“I bloody well hope so. It’s been a year.”“You can’t guilt me on that.”“I won’t stop trying,” said Harry lowly, coming closer. Draco was utterly fixated on him, and a thrill ran through Harry’s body as he realized this. “You already know how stubborn I am.”“And you, me,” Draco murmured, his eyes positively lingering on Harry’s lips.Their faces were so close and Harry burned with wanting to finally touch him grab him kiss him –“Face it. You might as well give up.”“I,” Draco paused for a beat, licking his lips, “Might be considering it.”“Could you consider letting me kiss you instead?” Harry asked, his voice hoarse as he searched Draco’s face for a clue.A series of emotions flashed over Draco’s pale face, which did nothing to mollify Harry, but then he gave a little huff, took hold of one of the lapels on Harry’s coat, and pulled him in for a rough kiss. Harry stumbled forward into Draco’s warm chest and though startled, he kissed back fiercely, his hands coming to rest firmly on Draco’s shoulders.Draco’s lips were surprisingly soft and Harry barely had to work to nudge them open; they gave way easily and soon it was all open-mouthed kisses and Harry could barely get enough of him. His senses were flooded by Draco, the taste of him, the smell, the sound – god, the little noises he made – and he wanted more –Draco pulled away as quickly as he’d come, and Harry was left with the cold air and a Draco who was somehow even more guarded standing a foot away from him.“Something about you,” Draco said, his voice low, “Makes me lose all of my senses. Ever since the beginning, you’ve blinded me.”“I – what?” Harry asked, feeling slow as if he’d been jolted awake.“I can’t control myself around you,” Draco snapped, turning away from Harry in frustration. “I told you tonight – very plainly, I might add – that I wanted to do this right, take it slow, but what do I do? I kiss you like a fucking wanker – ““I don’t think you were a wanker,” Harry cut in.“Going back on my word and doing something I really shouldn’t have,” Draco continued as though Harry had said nothing. “And I know I don’t have the strongest constitution, or willpower, or whatever the fuck, but I could’ve at least held firm to this.”“Why this, Draco?”“Because it’s important,” Draco finished. He turned back around to face Harry, a completely defeated expression his face.Harry’s heart thudded sickeningly in his chest. “It’s – it’s fine, Draco. We can just forget that it happened, do it right –“Draco gave a humorless laugh.“Do it right this time,” Harry continued desperately, “If you’re so hellbent on taking it slow, we’ll do it. I swear, I won’t do anything until you say it’s ok –““But that’s just it, Harry. You’ve done nothing wrong, it’s just me who’s going back on my word.”“Well, that’s fine too, then! So we won’t take it as slowly as we ‘should’ – so what? We’ve done everything else correctly, we waited a year, you’re not my Healer anymore, I’m in a good place, a really good place now, and I want you, Draco. It wasn’t just my fucking addiction brain making things up, either. I look at you now and I’m a hundred percent sure that I like you, I want to be around you, I want to snog you, I want to do a thousand other things with you, and from what I’ve seen, I think you want the same with me.”Harry was breathing hard now, wholly aware that they were causing a scene but not caring in the slightest. He just needed Draco to respond, say something back, but all he was doing was staring at Harry with wide eyes.“Draco,” he said softly, coming close again, “Say something. Please.”“If this goes badly,” Draco’s voice was hushed and his face was guarded, but he stepped closer, “I’m blaming myself.”“I’m responsible for myself. You aren’t,” Harry countered. He tentatively reached out to touch Draco’s face. “Is that a yes?”Draco let out a shaky breath. “Yes. Yes, I want you, I want all those things.”Harry’s heart soared as he beamed at Draco, beautiful Draco, and leaned in to kiss him. Draco kissed him back and this time it was so much gentler, more careful. Draco’s face was warm in Harry’s palm, and when Harry ran his thumb back and forth over Draco’s cheek, he shuddered just a little bit.They parted and Harry took in the sight of Draco just centimeters away from him, his grey eyes vibrant and his lips swollen and pink.“Do you think you can come back to mine?” Harry asked breathlessly.“Yes.”
 They arrived at the front door to Harry’s flat moments later, Draco clutching onto Harry’s arm like a lifeline. Harry fumbled with the keys and the two burst inside the dark space. After slamming the door shut behind them and flicking on the lights, they resumed their messy kisses and frantic touching.Touching Draco was like receiving jolts of electricity, and he did it again and again. He couldn't pull himself away, his hands searching every inch of Draco, wanting to know him all of him. After so long, Harry was on the verge of desperation and his heart thudded in his ears. "Fuck," Harry breathed out, not really of his own volition, but Draco seemed to share the sentiment, making a low noise in Harry's ear as he licked a stripe up Harry's neck. "Where's your bedroom?" Draco asked, his voice low and possessive and sending shivers up Harry's spine.“Come on.”He took Draco’s hand and led him into his bedroom through the dark. He climbed into bed first, then beckoned Draco to join him. Draco made quick work of undressing Harry, pausing only to press hot kisses onto his newly bare skin. Soon, Harry was naked while Draco was still fully clothed. "Merlin, Potter, you're so fucking gorgeous," Draco murmured as he began to unbutton his shirt, his grey eyes burning into Harry. He would have been self-conscious if not for the obvious desire in Draco's face.Draco shucked his shirt off aggressively, tossing it to the side, and crawled on his hands and knees on top of Harry. Harry's breaths were short as he looked up at Draco, wondering what would happen next. Draco lowered his hips and straddled Harry, startling a gasp out of him when he felt just how hard Draco was. This made Draco smirk, his hair falling in his eyes as he did so. Finally willing his body to move, Harry tucked the fallen strands back behind Draco's ear. His hand trailed down his pale face, down his bare chest, finally landing on the cloth restraining his cock. Harry gripped it through Draco's trousers, relishing the way Draco's body tensed. "So what were those thousand other things you wanted to do with me?" Draco asked when he’d regained composure, leaning in to suck the skin on Harry's collarbone."I reckon you’ll have to find those out for yourself,” Harry replied, his throat dry, now moving his hand slowly up and down Draco's lengthDraco made a low noise. “I’m sure you’ll help me, tough.”Harry slipped his hand into Draco's trousers, past the waistband of his pants and took hold of Draco's cock, already wet with precome. “Maybe.”Draco hissed as Harry stroked his cock methodically, up and down, his lean body taut. "Shut up. What do you - mmph, what are you?""That's rude, Malfoy," Harry replied smoothly, watching Draco’s face as he quickened his pace. "I'm a Leo. Did you know, Leos and Geminis are sexually compatible?""I'm going to need you to stop talking," Draco said, not answering the question and instead kissing Harry hard, slipping his tongue inside Harry’s mouth."Take these off," Harry muttered once they'd parted, hurriedly pushing Draco's clothes off. Draco kicked them away, and finally he was just as naked as Harry was. Then Harry said, "I'm a bottom.""Fucking hell, of course you are," Draco rolled his eyes before sitting up and flipping Harry over. Harry's heart pounded in excitement, and when Draco did nothing, Harry cleared his throat. "What are you doing back there?"As if startled, Draco also cleared his throat. A moment later, he said, "Hoping you'll let me taste you."Shivers ran down Harry's entire body, his brain going fuzzy at the thought. "Let you?""Some people don't like it," Draco was saying even as he drew close to Harry's hole. Harry twitched as Draco's hot breath went over it. "I'm really, really not one of those people.""Good," Draco said, then licked a stripe over Harry's arsehole. Harry shuddered and cursed under his breath. Encouraged, Draco continued to work Harry open, lapping and teasing. Draco's hands were now gripping Harry's arse tight; his fingertips pressing deep into the skin. When Harry subconsciously pressed his arse into Draco's face, Draco retaliated by sticking his tongue inside. Harry couldn't help the moan from escaping his lips even if he'd wanted to. He clutched the sheets tightly, his left cheek pressed flush against the bed. "Draco, fuck," Harry mumbled. Draco responded with a moan, one that made Harry think that eating arse was his most favorite hobby, though that couldn't possibly be true. "I need - I need you to fuck me," Harry was now saying desperately, while Draco tonguefucked him harder. "Draco, Draco, I need you inside -"Draco finally drew back, though his hands stayed firmly where they were. If Harry had the energy to turn back and look at him, he knew that Draco would be wearing the most infuriating grin. So he didn't turn back. He just panted into the sweat-damp sheets. Draco whispered something, and then Harry heard the click of a cap opening. He looked back then, at Draco rubbing lube over his erect cock and hands, such nice hands and long fingers, Harry thought dazedly."You ready, Potter?""You know I've been ready, you bastard."Draco didn't deign to respond, instead stuck a finger inside Harry, who gasped and shuddered. After Draco took a while pumping it in and out, he added another finger, and then another. By then, Harry was desperate and pleading. "Please please just put it inside me, I need you now, Draco, god -"His entire body shuddered as Draco pushed inside, slowly and carefully. Harry closed his eyes, relaxing and loosening around Draco. Draco gave a ragged gasp as he drew out and back in again, his hands gripping Harry tighter than ever. "Merlin, you feel good," Draco murmured in a rough voice, and Harry ascended. Draco picked up the pace after this, driving in deeper with every thrust. The slap of flesh on flesh and panting filled the otherwise silent room, and Harry closed his eyes again and relished the sound. He was achingly hard but was avoiding touching his own cock, wanting to enjoy this as long as possible. "Harder, harder," Harry babbled. Draco complied, and Harry said more nonsense. "God yes Draco harder please," Harry was only half-aware of what he was saying but that didn't stop him. Draco's cock was thick and warm and filled him up so completely -"I'm getting close.""Can I," Draco ground out, "Slap you, Potter?""Fuck, god yes," Harry gasped, amazed that he didn't come just from Draco asking that question.Draco answered with a hard smack. Harry moaned and Draco slapped his arse again, harder this time. Harry's hand slipped down to his own cock and he began rubbing it vigorously. Draco was still pounding into him and it only took a few moments before Harry came with a shout, his entire body tensing as he spilled all over himself. Draco finished right after, his fingernails clawing into Harry's lower back and seemingly staying quiet only with great effort. Slowly, he pulled out of Harry, leaving him sticky and dripping.Harry rolled over onto his side as Draco collapsed onto the bed next to him. His face was hot as he watched the other man breathe deep, his chest rising and falling rhythmically. Draco seemed to feel Harry's eyes on him; he looked at him out of the corner of his eye before rolling on his side to face Harry."So, that was…" Harry began before trailing off, embarrassed. "What, you're suddenly shy now? What happened to 'harder Draco, please Draco,'" Draco asked, adopting a falsetto in order to mimic Harry, whose face was now burning. "I don't sound like that, you prat," Harry said, gently slapping Draco's arm. "You keep telling yourself that," Draco said smugly, but then grew serious. "Was it alright, though? I know I said we'd take it slow…""Oh, get over it, Malfoy," Harry huffed. "I'm not fragile. If I said it's fine, then it's fine. I almost prefer you mean. My arse still stings, by the way."Draco gave a short laugh at that. "You loved it."“What are you, by the way?""Hmm? You said it yourself, I'm a Gemini.""Malfoy.""Vers.""Ok."They fell into a comfortable silence, but then Draco said, "On your back…""Huh? Oh," Harry understood his meaning now. "It was sort of a present. To myself. For reaching one year.""It's beautiful," Draco said softly. "Can I?"Harry shrugged and turned back onto his stomach, allowing Draco free reign over his back. He felt Draco's careful hands run over the inked skin. "Why a…""Dragons are cool," Harry said simply. "I could be deep and say they've played a big part in my life, or that they're tough and resilient or whatever, but I just like the look of it.""Me too," Draco breathed. "Yeah, alright, Healer Dragon," Harry said as he shifted once again onto his back. He avoided looking at Draco before saying, "No one else has ever seen it before.""What?""I dunno, the chance just never came up. I'm obviously clothed when I leave the house, and much as I love Ron and Hermione, I'm not about to randomly strip and force them to look at something like that.""It wouldn't be that strange," Draco said."I dunno," Harry said again. "Well, either way...I'm honored. Thanks for trusting me with it, Harry."Harry looked up at the ceiling, embarrassed. “Fucking hell, Draco, it’s like you’re two completely different people.”“Sorry?”Harry glanced over at him, trying to gauge his response.“I don’t know what to expect, Healer you with all the reassuring words and kind smiles versus rude you who really just gets off on insulting me. And fucking me,” Harry added thoughtfully.“Just expect the mean one when I’m fucking you then,” Draco said, apparently amused by Harry’s predicament.“No, er, forget I ever said anything,” Harry said quickly. “I don’t – it’s just me being stupid.”“I’m not trying to disarm you or anything, Harry,” Draco said with a frown. “I have to carry myself differently at work; I’ve got to be a professional and caring for people is in my job description. I suppose it might be unsettling for me to move away from that…persona, since that’s really the only side of me you’ve seen in a while.”“You just did it again,” Harry half-laughed. When Draco made to say something, Harry hurriedly said, “It’s really just me being stupid about it. It’s not a big deal, Draco.”Draco seemed skeptical.“I’ll get used to it. I’ll be seeing more of you, I’m sure.”“That I can believe,” Draco said. He paused, then said, “I could make a literal hat that says ‘Healer hat’ just to clarify, if you’d like. I’ll wear it every time I say something not-mean.”“I hate you.”
 Draco had left shortly after that, pulling on his clothes and saying that he had work the next morning. Harry watched him go, then laid in bed and stared up at the ceiling, his head still spinning from all that had happened.He stayed in the same position for a good ten minutes before getting out of bed and shakily walking himself to the shower. He was sore in the best way possible, in the way that he hadn’t been in literal years. Harry winced as he bent to turn on the water. As he waited for the water to turn hot, he glanced at himself in the mirror, pleasantly surprised by what he’d saw.Though he was covered in a thin sheen on sweat, his hair a complete mess, and his lower neck was littered with bruises, he looked…happy. Relaxed, even. It felt like a huge weight had been taken off his shoulders, and he owed it all to Draco Malfoy. Rotating so he could see his back in the mirror, he grinned at the red scratches and even redder patch on his arse. He owed that to Draco, as well.
 Harry firecalled Ginny the next morning. When her face appeared in the fire, tired and yawning, he asked if she’d go get coffee with him. She declined citing tiredness, so Harry offered to bring coffee (plus pastries) for the two of them (and Blaise!). She nodded and disappeared.He was outside Ginny and Blaise’s flat half an hour later, hands full of steaming goods. Harry kicked the door twice and called out Ginny’s name, and soon the door was opening, revealing a freshly showered Ginny in a washed out top and gym shorts.“Morning, Harry,” she said as she took the pastry bag from him. “Come in.”They walked together into the kitchen, where Harry set the cup tray on the counter. Ginny had already dug out her almond croissant and taken a bite.“Blaise…?”“He’s still in the shower,” Ginny shot him an impish smile.“Ah, right,” said Harry. He passed Ginny’s latte over to her and took his own, holding it in his hands as he tried to figure out the best course of action. “I, er…”“What’s wrong, Harry?” Ginny asked, mild concern in her eyes. “Just say whatever you need to say. I’m here.”“I slept with Draco,” Harry said quickly, his face growing increasingly hot. “Last night. I just – I dunno.”“That’s good, isn’t it?”“Of course!”“Then why do you look like you’re telling me that you’ve accidentally killed someone? As long as the both of you had fully consented, then that’s great news! You’ve only been fawning over him for ages.”“Of course we both consented,” Harry sputtered, bewildered. “I’m just feeling…strange.”Ginny moved forward in her seat, leaning closer to Harry. “Why strange?”“I’m scared, I guess? I don’t really know what happens next, I mean, he’s told me he doesn’t like one-offs, but still. He basically spent over a year rejecting me, so what if he just changes his mind again? And never mind he’s the first person I’ve shagged in years – like, actual years, Gin.”“Oh, please, Malfoy’s an alright bloke and he’s almost as obsessed with you as you are with him. I’ll lop off my arm if he breaks things off with you. Now that you’ve finally gotten the green light from him, I’m seeing a lot of action in your future,” Ginny said confidently, grinning again. “But really, Harry, years?”“Years,” confirmed Harry gravely. “My memory’s still hazy for the past…well, a long time, and I honestly can’t remember the last time. Don’t kill me, but when did we break things off?”“I should really splash this on you,” said Ginny, though she didn’t actually sound upset. “December 2003. Come to think of it, our split-versary is coming up soon. Three beautiful years without you.”Harry winced. “Split-versary, huh? Don’t think I’ve heard that one before.”“That’s because it’s a new one,” a new voice said, and both Harry and Ginny snapped up to look at Blaise, who was entering the kitchen with just a towel wrapped around his slim waist. He lounged against the counter casually, amused eyes fixed on Ginny. “What was it last year, love? Didn’t run off the tongue as smoothly as this year’s.”“Oh, I think it was Two Years Since Harry James Potter Broke Up With Me In A Drunken Rage,” Ginny answered without missing a beat. “You’re right, split-versary is much better.”Blaise laughed as he came up behind Ginny and took his coffee and pastry.“I agree,” said Harry, who was still cringing in his seat. “Think you should discontinue that, er, other one.”“Or I could bring it back for next year. Four Years Since – ““Yeah, alright, we get it,” Harry quickly interrupted. “Harry Potter’s a giant prat, we know this. Why am I here again?”“You came to tell me you’ve slept with someone,” Ginny told him helpfully.Blaise’s laughter suddenly broke off; he was now staring at Harry with an unsettling intensity. “This ‘someone’ better be who I think it is, because if not, Potter, I’ll personally dismember you and dump your remains in the River Thames.”“What is with you lot and chopping off body parts? It was Malfoy, by the way,” Harry added uncertainly.“Good, I’ll have to pass along my congratulations. Poor boy’s been whinging about you for half our lives.”Ginny, who sat in front of Blaise unseen, grinned and shot Harry a thumbs up.“See?” she mouthed.

Chapter Text
Draco couldn't seem to decide if he should be impossibly happy or wracked with guilt, and it was driving him mental. The battle waging inside him must have been outwardly apparent as well, since Leo, Betty, and Ira all asked him if he was ok. "You ok, boss?" Leo asked after Draco had given him a pre-shift. "What? Of course I am."Leo raised his eyebrows and shrugged. "If you say so."Betty had cautiously asked him if he was alright when they'd run into each other in the break room. "I am. Thank you for the concern, Betty.""Of course, Healer. We're all here for you," she told him kindly before walking away."You look horrible," Ira had said once Draco had entered the break room just moments after Betty had left. "Thanks," said Draco shortly. "What's wrong, Draco? The last time I'd seen that look on your face was...well, a good while ago. I'd even say it was when you were dealing with your little Harry Potter fiasco -"Draco shot Ira a silencing glare. Eternally grateful that no one was in the break room but them, he gritted out, "If you'd like to take a walk over to your office, we can continue this conversation there. Otherwise, please stop talking.""Ooh, touchy. Go on then, make your coffee and I'll meet you there."Ira left before Draco could come up with an excuse or retort."There you are. You certainly took your time, didn't you?"Draco's mind was buzzing with annoyance as he shut the door behind him. "Ira, I'm two seconds away from pulling out my hair, so if you could please just keep the quips at bay for a moment."Ira was silent as Draco took a seat, placed his coffee on Ira's desk, and put his head in his hands. "I'm sorry, I shouldn’t have snapped at you," Draco said when he'd finally resurfaced. "It's alright, Draco, but would you like to tell me what's going on? You look dreadful.""As you’ve said already," Draco sighed heavily. "I couldn't sleep last night. I might have gotten four hours if I'm being generous. Remember when Harry was here, and he was my patient?""Do I remember?" asked Ira incredulously. "He was the talk of our little St. Mungo’s town for a good few months. And what of our Savior?"Draco refrained from rolling his eyes. "Well, it's complicated, but to keep it short, we met up yesterday after a year of not seeing each other and we had sex."Ira's jaw had dropped, their eyes wide as they regarded Draco curiously. "Really?""Yes, really, and now I'm halfway regretting it, much as I hate to say it. Just because of all the complexities of our relationship…I was his Healer, and he was in a bad place, obviously, when he was in my care. I told him we couldn't do anything for at least a year after he began recovery because I didn't want to risk anything, and now it’s been a year, but I'm still worried that it was wrong of me to – to take advantage."“Merlin, Draco,” said Ira tiredly. “At this rate I should start charging you. Do you think I’d be suited for a career change? Mind Healer White. How’s that sound?”“I’ll pay you in lunch,” Draco challenged. “How’s that sound?”Ira rolled their eyes good-naturedly."Some other time, Draco. It won't take me long to tell you this: if you sincerely think he's in a good place now – both physically and mentally, then I think you're fine. You have a good sense of judgement and if he's looking and acting healthy, I can't find any reason to not do what you'd like. And you haven't been his Healer in over a year, so there’s no more pesky power imbalance. It's very good of you to worry, but I think in this case, you're perfectly alright."Draco took this in, then said, "I thought you said it wouldn't take long.""You really can be a twat sometimes, can't you?”"No, no, Ira, I'm sorry," said Draco, scrubbing a hand over his face. "I’m just massively exhausted, not that it's any excuse. Thank you, Ira. Really. You don't need to listen to my rubbish, but you always do anyway."Ira regarded him carefully."Alright, I'll accept your apology. What’s the next step?""See him again, hopefully.""How sweet. Will you reach out to him, or will you wait?""Salazar, I don't know. I haven't dated anyone in nearly two years, and that was Leo…""Lest we forget," Ira sighed. "As long as you and Mr. Potter don’t start shagging in the storage closet twice a week, we’ll all be fine.""Don't remind me," Draco said, flushing with embarrassment. He looked away, momentarily lost in thought. "I don't know what I was thinking; I could have lost my job. And it wasn’t twice a week," he added defensively, glaring at Ira."You were probably thinking something like 'I've never seen such a fit American before, I need his cock up my arse right now,'" Ira said with a smirk.“Jesus, Ira. I wasn’t that predatory. Or vulgar.”"Are you trying to say you weren’t predatory? Because Draco, he was practically an innocent little lamb when he first transferred over here, and then you had to go and have your way with him.""I'm going to...ignore that and ask that we switch back to the original topic,” Draco said uncomfortably. “I'm rusty when it comes to dating, but so is Potter, so that can either be a good thing or a bad thing.""Just owl him. Or better yet, text him! It's what all the young people are doing nowadays. You don't really want to run the risk of losing him after all this effort, do you?""No, you're right. I really don't. But I don’t have his number," Draco paused, thinking.“Fine, owl him. Ask him for his number.”Once again, Draco sighed. "I really do owe you for forcing you to listen to all my drama."Ira waved a hand dismissively. "You know I love gossip, Draco. And you already know most of this is going to Betty.""It's a wonder she’s able to take me seriously with all the rubbish you've been putting in her head about me.""It's a mark of respect. Take pride, Draco."Draco gave a weak laugh and bid Ira goodbye.Later that night, Draco bravely wrote a cordial letter explaining that he had a nice time and would he please provide Draco with his mobile number so they could communicate that way also?His owl returned not half an hour later with eleven hasty numbers scrawled on a scrap of paper.Draco sat on his bed and carefully entered the number into his contacts page. The name? What should he put? He decided on ‘HP.’ Simple and to-the-point.He stared down at his mobile. A blank message screen stared back at him. With effort, he slowly typed in his first attempt.Potter, had nice time last night. If u would like, I'd enjoy meeting up again. Let me know. D Malfoy.No, that wasn't right.
Harry, I had a good time. When would u like to see each other again? Draco. 
He wanted to banish himself from the world.
Harry, it was v nice to see u. Would u like to meet up again sometime soon? Draco
This one made him cringe a little less than the other two, and before he could deliberate more on it, he pressed send.Throwing the mobile far away from him, he stood and went to brush his teeth. He checked his mobile once he's reentered the bedroom, but to his dismay, he hadn't gotten a response yet."You are a grown man," Draco muttered to himself as he fell into bed. "He's a busy person, and it's late. Shut up."And then he fell asleep.Draco woke the next morning disoriented, feeling unsettled for whatever reason. It only took a few moments for him to remember that it was because of the awful text message he’d sent Potter. He lay in bed a few moments, wishing that he’d never sent the stupid text in the first place. He’d never listen to Ira again.After he’d gathered the courage to leave his bed, he walked steadfastly past his mobile and into the kitchen. He sat there for a while, absentmindedly drinking a cup of coffee.Perhaps it was the coffee jumpstarting his nerves, but Draco slipped off his chair and made his way to the bedroom, his heart pattering a distracting beat high in his chest.Flipping his phone open, he watched as it lit up and displayed words that made Draco’s heart beat even faster. ONE NEW MESSAGE.
It was great to see u 2. How does Sun work for u?
Draco was about to choose ‘reply’ when his phone buzzed. He paused and opened the new message.
Wait, what are u doing now
Perplexed, Draco sent a reply as quickly as he could. Nothing.
Are u at home? 

Can I visit u? 

I’ll bring breakfast. 

Just text me ur address.
Draco’s heart was racing. Was it acceptable for him to see Harry again so soon? And Merlin, his flat was a mess. He’d have to clean up if Harry was coming over. Oh, what was he thinking? This was ridiculous. Harry was ridiculous.Fine, Draco typed, his palms sweaty. He entered in his address and hit send before he could rethink it.“Oh, bugger,” said Draco before stomping off he retrieve his wand.He quickly tidied up, sending things back to where they belonged – dirty robes, old socks, empty mugs and dishes. He made his bed haphazardly, grunting in frustration when one of his pillows fell off to the side.Draco hadn’t even realized just how messy his flat had become; he had no one to impress now, and he was at work more often than he was at home. It hadn’t been a priority for Draco in a long time.A knock at the door made Draco jump. He spared a glance in the mirror and quickly flattened his hair. And then he realized he was still wearing his pajamas. They were fine for himself and for his home, but for Harry? He agonized over it for a few moments before giving up and going to answer the door, already embarrassed.Harry stood there, bright sunshine filtering in from behind him and acting as a halo. Draco blinked and squinted; his eyes were slow to adjust to the sunlight.“Morning,” Harry chirped.“Come in,” Draco said, and stepped back to let Harry inside.  “Thanks.” Harry shot him a grin and came inside, his gaze wandering around the flat before finally landing on Draco. He looked Draco up and down and smiled, “Hope I didn’t wake you up?”Draco felt ridiculously underdressed with Harry in his Muggle street clothes and him in his favorite silk pajamas. Merlin, and what kind of person had silk pajamas? He made a mental note to himself: tone down the gay, Draco.“No, no, I was awake. Just…barely,” Draco admitted.Harry laughed. He held out his arms and Draco saw what he was holding – a cup carrier with two to-go coffees and a paper bag which must have held pastries. “Could you just grab these? I want to take off my coat.”“Of course,” Draco said. He took the items and watched as Harry pulled off a heavy black coat and hung it up on Draco’s coat rack. “Please, make yourself welcome. Kitchen is through here.”Draco took them from the landing to the kitchen. He set everything down on the island and examined the coffees.“This is nice, Draco,” Harry told him appreciatively, his green eyes once again sweeping the room. “That one’s vanilla, the other mocha. Hope you like one of them, I wasn’t sure what to get.”“Vanilla’s great.” Draco took the one Harry had pointed to first and took a deep drink. “That’s perfect. Thanks.”“Course.”They sat in silence drinking their coffee.Harry was the one who broke the silence unexpectedly. “I feel bad now.”This took Draco off guard. “What? Why?”“Cos I sort of just barged in here and interrupted your morning.”Draco huffed out a laugh. “Don’t even worry about it. I wasn’t going to be doing anything.”Harry raised an eyebrow. “Oh? You don’t work today?”“No, thank Merlin,” Draco sighed.“Long week?”“Very,” Draco grumbled.“Wanna talk about it?”“Aside from my unusually heavy case load and the lack of sleep, I got contacted by some arsehole I knew from school.”Harry perked up at this, his green eyes bright. “Oh?”“Yeah,” Draco said, glad Harry decided to play along instead of getting bristly. “Not a word for ages and then he just drops the old ‘want to meet up?’ one day, like he thinks I’ll drop everything for him.”“Sounds like a prick,” Harry said convincingly before taking a slow sip of his coffee.“He is. Of course, I did drop everything for him because that’s just the kind of effect he has on people,” Draco continued, watching as Harry’s playful smile began to falter. He stood, slowly, keeping eye contact with Harry as he did so. He moved closer. “Especially on me. And I don’t even think he knows it.”“Oh,” Harry cleared his throat; his voice was rough, “Then what happened?”“Oh, I saw him. He looked incredible, naturally. Better, really, in every shape of the word. I was hoping to just get him out of my system, but the opposite happened.”“Yeah? And what’s that?”Draco was standing over Harry now, who was staring up at him with an unreadable expression.“I want you even more, you arsehole,” Draco said quietly, losing his strength. He looked away, unable to face Harry.“If it helps, I want you too,” Harry offered in a low voice. “I can’t stop thinking about that night.”“I…me neither,” Draco replied, his throat suddenly dry.How could Harry make him so stupid? Ever since they were children, Harry’s always incited such a visceral reaction within him, making him lose all common sense.“I was afraid that you’d change your mind,” Draco admitted against better judgement. “I thought maybe…I don’t know.”“God, believe me, I haven’t,” Harry said, coming ever closer. “I know you find this hard to believe, but I really like you, Draco.”Draco let out a shuddering breath. This incredible man, someone who had been through so much, had done so much, and yet was so much more than all of that, wanted him. It still boggled his mind. He didn’t think it would ever make sense.Unable to articulate any of his feelings, Draco took Harry’s face in his hands and kissed him hard. His fingers brushed against the stubble on Harry’s cheeks, which also scraped gently against Draco’s own smooth-shaven face. He nudged Harry’s mouth open and kissed him deeper, coaxing a moan from him.They parted and Draco had to close his eyes to collect himself.“I really like you too,” Draco replied when he got his breath back.Which is part of why this is all so ridiculous and such a bad idea.He couldn’t say that part though, much as he believed it. Wasn’t this happening all too fast? Wasn’t there still residual effects of Draco having been Harry’s Healer? And, not to mention, their childhoods?“Draco?”Harry’s voice snapped him out of it. He was looking at Draco with concern – how long had he been lost in thought? Draco colored and stepped back.“I’m fine,” Draco said quickly. “Sorry.”“You sure?”“Yeah, I’m good.”Draco didn’t blame Harry for giving him a doubtful look.“It’s not especially comforting when you tell me you like me, but then look like you’re contemplating how to tell me you ran over my dog.”“You don’t have a dog,” Draco said, dumbfounded. “I don’t have a car.”“Not the point.”“Sorry, it’s just me – “ Draco stopped and huffed out a frustrated breath. “It’s me putting my Healer hat on again. Overthinking things. Worrying about things,” Draco emphasized, hoping Harry would understand.“Oh,” Harry bit his lip. “Still?”“Not by choice, I promise you.”“Look, if you’re really all that worried about it – ““What happened to ‘it’s my choice, Draco, say yes’?” Working so hard to convince me?”Harry looked a bit stung by this, and Draco immediately regretted his words. “If I overstepped –““No, I’m sorry. That wasn’t fair,” Draco interrupted. “You haven’t done anything wrong.”Draco sighed and backed away, sat down. He frowned at Harry, who was watching him reproachfully.“You didn’t even let me finish,” Harry said. “I was going to say, if you’re still worried about it, we can just take it slower. Or hell, take a break. I know I’m comfortable with where I’m at, but if you’re not, we can slow it down.”“No, I want to do this. I really do,” Draco said firmly. “I just have to – I don’t know – stop thinking of worst-case scenario. Just think about the best-case one instead.”This got a little smile out of Harry. “Which is?”“I think I’ll keep that one to myself a little longer.”Harry accepted this with relative ease. “Fair enough.”
