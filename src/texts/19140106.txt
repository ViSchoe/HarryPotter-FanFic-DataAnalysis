Harry Potter have now got a phone because teacher asked for home number and I 'accidentally' forgot, and the teacher wrote a letter saying that I need a phone to remember numbers on. Still wonders what he did in a past life to deserve such horrible treatment. And he's considering the possibility of emancipation, the phone is old and used, but at least have internet.

Harry Potter is actually enjoying himself, had an ice lolly for the first time, it tasted sweet and cold. *^*
Harry Potter added "talking to snakes" to interests.

Dudley Dursley WAS ATTACKED BY A GIANT SNAKE, IT NEARLY BIT OFF MY LEG!
Petunia Dursley: MY POOR POOR DIDDIKINS! MUMMY MADE YOU GO THROUGH SOMETHING SO HORRIBLE, I WILL MAKE UP FOR IT. 2 MORE PRESENTS!
Harry Potter: You were not.
Piers Polkiss: You were talking to it! Probably told it to kill us! Did you see? It was was huuuuuggggeeee, probably 10000m long, I swear it tried to squeeze me to death!
Harry Potter: No...it didn't go anywhere near enough to kill you, if you were clever enough to read that snake was no where near 10000m, now everyone's gonna think I set a snake on you guys, family stuff? I don't think so. I, like you, have no idea what happened either, perhaps even the snake was able to tell that you weren't a good person.

Vernon Dursley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Go - cupboard - stay - no meals-right now
Vernon Dursley wrote on Petunia Dursley's wall: GET ME A BRANDY.
Petunia Dursley: Yes, dear, of course.
Harry Potter of course my life can't be happy for more than five minutes. No meals? Stay? What am I? A dog? I just said I had no idea what happened, but then again no one would believe me even if I did explain. Some would constitute this as child abuse...

You-Know-Who came to your house and killed your parents, because they were part of the resistance. He tried to kill you, but failed. That's why you have that scar on your forehead. It's pure EVIL. But that's why you're famous: first to ever survive the Killing Curse. I'll Inbox you the whole story, it was pretty badass.Vernon Dursley: THIS IS A LOAD OF CRAP, HE'S A FREAK LIKE HIS PARENT, THAT, AND NOTHING ELASE.Harry Potter: I totally forgot you existed for a moment.

Vernon Dursley:BE GRATEFUL WE'LL EVEN STILL HAVE YOU. Because of you, our home was defaced with letters, not to mention, when you left the shack with your giant oaf of a friend, you shot us all two middle fingers.
Harry Potter:Yes, the only act of rebellion in my ten years of living in your house was a rude gesture as I left towards the one glimmer of hope in my entire life. Yeah, I've really disrespected you.
Dudley Dursley:As always, just shut up, Harry. These past few days without you have been the best days of my life. I even gained a grain of respect back for my father.
Harry Potter:I have been gone for a single day though, seriously, went out in the morning, was back at night..
Dudley Dursley:To be honest, even a moment of bliss without you feels like years.

Harry Potter is starting to feel invisible. For some reason, this is worse than being constantly despised by the Dursleys. I mean it's nice that at least they are not forcing me to do anything, but the are not saying ANYTHING, STOP IGNORING ME!

Harry Potter: o.o Dumbledore! AHHHHH! :D Anyways, why do they even have that option?!
Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore: You can't seriously expect us to use normal muggle equipments and pages do you? I mean, every time a "Magical word" is used, all the muggle's gonna see is some random word like "book" or "cake" in it's place. Similarly they can only see your post because you are a wizard. With all this Muggle regulations sadly it means they have trouble seeing what your muggle relatives have been posting, UNLESS of course they have are commenting on this or if they themsleves have both befriended muggles, wizards and you all respectively. HOWEVER due to certain reasons...you will have to stay there for another 7 years...or so. But ANYWAYS, I shallsend the full wizard kit to you later, save you to trouble of using muggle phones. There's another thing as well...ah, I shall leave you to find out yourself.

Dudley Dursley:What am I, Pothead? No one or a great lump of meat?
Harry Potter: Gah! Dudley, I said get!
Dudley Dursley:Ohh I'm so scared of you. I'm so scared of you and your lover Ronnie and your magic school.

Harry Potter: great...just great and no.
Ronald Weasley:You know her already! She looks obnoxious. Also, she has bushy hair.
Hermione Jean Granger:And you are...? You're doing magic? Let's see.
Ronald Weasley: What the...? Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow, Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow...well...nothing
Hermione Jean Granger: Wow. You're terrible at you sure that's a real spell? Nobody in my family is magic at all, and I'm the very best already, see!
Ronald Weasley is severely upset about having Granger as a friend, not sure why she added me if she just insulted my magic...BLOCKKKKK! Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not in it. She's rude, annoying, condescending, and pretty unfortunate looking.
Hermione Jean Granger: Excuse me? You aren't so pretty yourself. AND need I remind you, you can't block people on wizard facebook nor can you unfriend them without a complicated bit of magic. At least do some reading if you knew you were going to be coming to Hogwarts, The BEST school ever.
Ronald Weasley: Yeah, okay. I'm adorable. Don't need you to recognize that, it's true. By the way, Harry and I both think you're totally creepy right now.
Hermione Jean Granger: I can see we're going to have a very interesting, tension-filled relationship.
Ronald Weasley: Yeah, whatever, Granger. Listen, I really, truly couldn't give a damn. I was perfectly content shoving candy down my throat before you showed up and forced me to question my place in the wizarding world and the fact that I might be totally suck at magic. Thanks for that. Really.
Hermione Jean Granger: I will never apologize for being myself.
Ronald Weasley: Yeah, well I expect you'll be very, very lonely then, Granger. Have fun.

Harry Potter: Um...I don't know any. I don't know if I mentioned this, BUT I WAS COMPLETELY UNAWARE OF BEING A WIZARD AND THE ENTIRE MAGICAL WORLD IN GENERAL UP UNTIL ONE MONTH AGO.
Ronald Weasley: Oh, right. Heh.
Dudley Dursley: Seriously, Harry? This is your boyfriend? You couldn't find anyone better?
Harry Potter: DUDLEY, SHUT UP AND GET!

Before we provide you with food, since I know you haven't eaten a proper meal since the morning (honestly, why doesn't the Hogwarts Express provide lunch? Candy is not an acceptable substitute!), you will have to be sorted into your houses. Your house is like your family. You will spend every waking and sleeping moment with these people, so you better get along. The houses are listed as follows: Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin (the last house was written with disdain – I AM the Head of Gryffindor, after all). Triumphs = earned points, rule-breaking = lost points. The house with the most points gets the House Cup, the greatest honor. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up as much as you can while you wait for me to come back to get you for the sorting. I'm specifically calling out the ginger with the dirt on his nose and the dolt whose cloak is fastened under his left ear. If you two are in my house, I will contemplate retiring.Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: SEE! I TOLD YOU. YOU SHOULD'VE LISTENED TO ME.

Harry Potter:Wait...why do I feel like I'm trapped in a Dr. Seuss book?
Ronald Weasley:Who's Dr. Seuss? (Let me clarify, I'm asking Harry, not giving you an excuse to flaunt your disgusting intellect, GRANGER.)
Hermione Jean Granger:I don't really give a shit and I will flaunt my intellect for all of the world to see whenever I choose. Theodor Seuss Geisel was an American writer and cartoonist most widely known for his children's books, written under the pen names Dr. Seuss, Theo LeSieg, and even Rosetta Stone! He published over 60 children's books, which were often characterized by imaginative characters, rhyme, and the trisyllabic meter. The book I think Harry is trying to refer to is One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish...you know, with the repetitive way in which he lists the types of stairs that exist here?
Ronald Weasley:How does it make you feel that I read absolutely none of that?
Hermione Jean Granger:I don't care. As long as everyone looks at my Facebook Page one day and sees long paragraphs of useless information, and they look at each other and go "hey, that girl must be intelligent," well then, I've lived my life to its fullest capacity.
Ronald Weasley:As usual, fuck you, you spoiled only child.
Hermione Jean Granger:You're just jealous that I had, have, and will always have my parents full attention. It is the way that I was taught to walk, talk, and read at the tender age of 3 months.
Ronald Weasley:First of all, the fact that you have literally been talking, non-stop, for that amount of time is disgusting to me. Picturing a three-month-old baby with a full head of frizzy, bush-like hair, spouting useless, garbled nonsense is literally making me want to vomit. Second of all, five is a perfectly normal time to begin speaking.

Hermione Jean Granger thinks that Ronald Weasley is just sad because he only started talking six years ago ): I will have to teach him to read myself!
Ronald Weasley:And why do you assume that I don't know how to read? I'm reading your comments, aren't I?

Harry Potter:Yes, obviously. That's your purpose.
Hedwig the Owl sent Harry Potter a letter from Hagrid.
Hedwig the Owl added "finding a way to murder Harry Potter" to their interests.
Harry Potter:Well, isn't that sweet.
Hedwig the Owl:Meep – that's owl for fuck you, you fucking dip shit. Find a way to grow wings and fly your stupid damn crappy letters back and forth to NO ONE, cause nobody gives a shit you whiny little brat.
Harry Potter:O_O
Hedwig the Owl:Yeah, I went there. Oh, and I'm with Mrs. Norris.
Harry Potter:How is that even POSSIBLE?
Hedwig the Owl:Why don't you just keep that image in your mind forever and try to figure it out yourself? Give me your response, okay?
Harry Potter:Heh. That's funny, you still have to serve me. Tell Hagrid I would *love*to see him later on!
Hedwig the Owl:Oh? You want me to shit on Hagrid?
Harry Potter:NO! HEDWIG, I COMMAND YOU TO LISTEN TO ME!
Hedwig the Owl:What? Sorry, I can't hear you, I'm too busy banging Mrs. Norris.

Harry Potter wrote on Rubeus Hagrid's wall: Hagrid, I would love to see you later on, please. I'm sorry I can't respond in letter, but Hedwig and I got into a bit of an argument and let's just say things got really crass. I'm not sure we're ever going to be on speaking terms again. He said a lot of...unforgiveable things.
Rubeus Hagrid:Really? SHE seemed really pleasant to me. Hedwig is a girl...
Harry Potter:Are you kidding me?
Rubeus Hagrid:No, definitely a girl.
Harry Potter:I literally have always thought she was a boy.
Rubeus Hagrid:Well, she's definitely a lesbian. Her and Mrs. Norris have had relations.
Harry Potter:Uh, you know about this?
Rubeus Hagrid:Of course, I help them sneak around Filch. He has no idea.

Argus Filch is no longer in a relationship.
Mrs. Norris:Wtf?
Argus Filch:You actually think I'm a moron, Betty? You think I'm a STUPID? I'm a human being. I have FEELINGS. We had BIG PLANS.
Mrs. Norris:WE STILL DO!
Argus Filch:No, we don't! You ruined what we had, you ruined all of our plans, when you chose to sleep with that STINKY SLUT Hedwig.
Harry Potter:Excuse me? No. That's my best friend you're talking about.
Ronald Weasley:Huh?
Harry Potter:Sorry, Ron, I meant my best friend that pecks and poops on others for sport.
Ronald Weasley:Yes?
Harry Potter:Um...okay. I think that we all just have to stop right now because things are getting out of hand. We're all finding out things we never wanted to know. EVER.
Hedwig the Owl:Am I really your best friend?
Harry Potter:Well, I'm running out of characteristics to separate you and Ron. But yes, you are very important to be Hedwig. I'm sorry I disrespected you. You can also sleep with whomever you please.
Argus Filch:EXCEPT MY WOMAN.
Harry Potter:Okay, Filch? Listen...maybe it doesn't make sense for an owl and a cat to have "relations," but it's even...more mind-boggling for a human and a cat. It's just...it's literally not possible.
Argus Filch:To hell it isn't.
Mrs. Norris:Filch, you've constantly deluded me with fantasies of grandeur! For a life of happiness with you, where we skinned the children alive and feasted on them – together. But I realize that I'm just chasing a dream that you can never truly give me. I'm getting older, and I don't have time for this. I've found someone who can offer more than you. We're done. I'm sorry.

Severus Snape:What is the difference between monkshood and wolfsbane?
Hermione Jean Granger:CALL ON ME! I WILL PEE MY PANTS, I SWEAR!
Harry Potter:See...I really do think that Hermione knows. She's like, literally peeing herself. So...I don't know, I really just don't know what to say anymore. I keep saying the same thing but it's like...you're really just not listening to me so I'm at a loss. I feel like I'm talking to a brick wall. It's rather disconcerting.
Severus Snape:You really do think you're something special, don't you? You...you run your hands through that perfectly coiffed, jet-black hair and lean back in your chair and hit on beautiful red-heads and YOU JUST NEVER GIVE A SHIT ABOUT ANY OTHER HUMAN BEINGS, DO YOU? YOU JUST HEX THEM WHENEVER YOU LIKE AND YOU STEAL THEIR MAYBE-SOON-TO-BE GIRLFRIENDS AND YOU JUST LIVE YOUR LITTLE PRIVILEGED LIFE WITH YOUR LITTLE PRIVILEGED FRIENDS AND YOU NEVER HAVE A CARE IN THE WORLD!
Harry Potter:That...is...A LOT to take in. Wow...I am...I really don't know what to say to that. Um...there is...definitely a necessity for therapy. I don't mean that condescendingly, but it seems like you'll accuse me of that no matter what. Um...yeah. Please. I really don't know what you just said but I'm just...really frightened. Please get help. I say that so genuinely and so concernedly for your wellbeing.

Ronald Weasley: My life is better than Harry's, really. Harry wants my life.
Harry Potter: Make sure you repeat that every night before you go to sleep.
Ronald Weasley: Should I do it before or after my prayers?

Draco Malfoy cannot believe Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley are still at school! Am I supposed to expect this sort of special treatment for our entire stay at Hogwarts? I am not taking this...life is not real.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: Hey, mate! So, I totez know what's goin' on with the whole three-headed dog thing. It's hiding something, obviously. Possibly the grubby little package that I saw Hagrid take from vault 713! I mean Hogwarts IS the safest place to hide something.
Ronald Weasley:Bloody hell!!! Leave it to Hagrid to be so obvious that an eleven-year-old who literally just found out he was a wizard, like, 3 months ago, is able to work out a conspiracy like this.
Harry Potter:I know, even at Gringotts I was like, dude, if you're trying to let me in on this secret, you're doing great HAHA.
Ronald Weasley:lololol
Rubeus Hagrid: ...Yer know, I may be large but I have feelings!
Harry Potter:Sorry, Hagrid. It's no offense to you as a PERSON – we think you're great!
Ronald Weasley:Well, except for the rock cakes...that's another complaint. But just that – your inability to keep secrets, your rock cakes...oh, and also I'd think you'd be more tolerant towards gingers considering the mistreatment you endure being a giant.
Rubeus Hagrid:I ain't a giant! Not a full one!
Ronald Weasley:I'm rolling my eyes right now, Hagrid. Give me a break.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Anyway, as I was saying, Harry, the grubby little package is either really valuable or really dangerous.
Harry Potter:Or both...
Hermione Jean Granger:Neville and I both don't care at all what the package is. Actually, I'm not even speaking to you anymore.
Ronald Weasley:Bitch, you literally amaze me. NOBODY ASKED FOR YOUR OPINION.
Harry Potter:Yeah, if anything, we're glad you aren't interested. Maybe you'll keep your nose out of it, then?
Hermione Jean Granger:Don't count on it, boys.
Ronald Weasley:Now...was that "I'm not speaking to you anymore" some sort of practical joke or...?
Hermione Jean Granger:Starting NOW!
Neville Longbottom:By the way, that's not entirely true what you said, Hermione - it's not that I don't care, I'm just never going near that dog again. Speak for yourself.
Harry Potter:That understandable, Nev.
Ronald Weasley:Yeah, Granger. Leave Neville out of this. He has enough problems as it is.

Oliver Wood:But other than that, you're totally awesome. Lovin' the whole famous vibe. And you've got major skillz.
Harry Potter:Wow...skills with a "z?" You really do believe in me.
Oliver Wood:Yep! So, basically, there are seven players, three of which are called Chasers.
Harry Potter:Seven Players. Three Chasers.
Oliver Wood:Here's a Quaffle...the Chasers throw the Quaffle to each other and try and get it through one of the hoops to score a goal...ten points for each goal. Got it?
Harry Potter:That's a Quaffle, Chasers put it through the hoops to score, ten points a goal.
Oliver Wood:Right...a simple "yes," would suffice. We don't have all night, kid.
Harry Potter:Simple "yes," don't have all night. Got it.
Oliver Wood: Yeah...anyway, each side's got a Keeper, that'd be me. We fly around our respective hoops and stop the other team from scoring. I'm kind of a big deal. Then you've got two beaters, the Weasley twins, who try to protect their side from the Bludgers and knock 'em towards the other team.
Harry Potter:Have the Bludgers ever killed anyone?
Oliver Wood:Not at Hogwarts...yet...
Harry Potter:Foreshadowing?
Oliver Wood:I hope not! Sheesh, Potter. Why do you try so hard to attract danger?

Harry Potter:Was I ever...off?
Draco Malfoy:Maybe one minute or so after I heard about your existence, when I was two years old - only because I didn't know any better. But my father quickly taught me that Harry Potter = worthless junk. It was actually quite a fun bonding time for Daddy and I...he'd put Harry Potter on one side of a flash card and I'd have to answer: "worthless junk?" And he'd turn it around and if my answer matched the answer written on the back, I'd get a cookie!
Harry Potter:Wow...you're childhood may have been more horrific than mine.
Oliver Wood:Moving on...the Golden Snitch is the most important ball of the lot. It's very hard to catch because it's so fast and difficult to see. It's your job, Potter, as the Seeker, to catch it. Whichever Seeker catches the Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win!

Harry Potter:Thanks to you too, Hermione.
Hermione Jean Granger:You're quite welcome. And you, Ronald?
Ronald Weasley:Oh, I've said all I wanted to say.
Hermione Jean Granger:You're a horrid, horrid boy Ronald.
Ronald Weasley:Alright, alright. I'm fucking thankful to you for locking yourself in a bathroom and crying all day when I've said loads of worse things about AND to you. I'm thankful that I had to swallow my pride and run into said bathroom to knock out a fucking mountain troll for you. And I'm thankful that after all that, you managed to do exactly what you SHOULD have done, which is SOMETHING for Harry and I, like maybe not getting us in trouble FOR ONCE. If you hadn't done that, I wouldn't even bother calling you a bitch.
Hermione Jean Granger:Surprisingly...I'll take that.
Ronald Weasley:Well...cool.
J.K. Rowling:From that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out a twelve-foot mountain troll is one of them.
Ronald Weasley:Oh, come on, who the fuck invited this sap into the conversation? Sheesh...

Rubeus Hagrid is defrosting broomsticks on the Quidditch field. Why Rolanda Hooch isn't doing such a Quidditch-related task, I shall never know. (sent from mobile)
Rolanda Hooch: That's because cleaning is YOUR job.
Rubeus Hagrid: Actually, my job pertains to the keys and grounds of Hogwarts. I don't recall cleaning brooms being part of my job description! If it were, it would be part of my title. So...
Rolanda Hooch: ...Just do it.

Oliver Wood IT'S QUIDDITCH SEASON, Y'ALL!

Oliver Wood: GO GRYFFINDOR!
Marcus Flint: As if! SNAKES RULE!
Ravenclaw Qudditch Captain '91-'92: Honestly, Gryffindor and Slytherin are so childish. Quidditch is just a sport, for Merlin's sake. What's most important as our education here at this fantastic school of learning.
Oliver Wood:EVERYTHING IS ABOUT QUIDDITCH. FORGET EDUCATION.
Hufflepuff Qudditch Captain '91-'92:Why do we have to have such horrible rivalries? Why can't we work together and become better players together?
Marcus Flint:SOD OFF, HUFFLEPUFF LOSER. Imma kill your team next!

Harry Potter has no idea how his position on the Gryffindor team got leaked!
Ronald Weasley: Are you serious, mate? Wood practically wrote it as his status everyday, McGonagall has been taunting Snape in the corridors on a regular basis, and I recall you shoving having a Nimbus Two-Thousand in Malfoy's face in the Great Hall last week.
Harry Potter: NO CLUE AT ALL! NOPE, NOT A SINGLE CLUE!

Neville Longbottom wrote on Harry Potter's wall: You're going to be brilliant!
Draco Malfoy wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Crabbe and Goyle will be running around underneath you with a mattress! But then once you fall, we'll pull it away so you can land on your fat face! LOLZ.
Harry Potter: ...

Harry Potter is surprised to say this, but he's rather lucky that Hermione Jean Granger is his friend now.

Ronald Weasley: TRAITOR!
Harry Potter: I'M SORRY, but she's actually really useful – she practically does my homework now. And she lent me a sweet book: Quidditch Through the Ages, which has turned out to be an interesting read.
Ronald Weasley: I'M LOSING YOU, HARRY. YOU'RE TURNING INTO HER! SINCE WHEN DO YOU LIKE TO READ?
Hermione Jean Granger: Oh, stop overreacting, Ronald! And stop worrying – it's not like I'm going to try and ruin your quasi-relationship with him. I wouldn't dare try to mess with that!
Ronald Weasley: Oh my god, how many FUCKING times do we have to say that we're NOT lovers? Oh, by the way, Harry, make sure you sneak a canister of whipped cream for later...you know...
Hermione Jean Granger: ...

Harry Potter has just read that the most serious Qudditch accidents happen to Seekers. FML.

Hermione Jean Granger is with Ronald Weasley and Harry Potter in the freezing courtyard, doing some illegal magic, and actually doesn't mind doing it! (sent from mobile)
(Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley like this.)
Ronald Weasley: Wow, for the first time since I met you, I don't want to torture you to death. Don't get me wrong, I still want to kill you, but I would give you a quick one at this point.
Harry Potter: If I didn't know any better, Ron, I would say that was practically a love confession.
Ronald Weasley: HOLD YOUR TONGUE.

Severus Snape wrote on Harry Potter's wall: What's that you've got there, Potter?
Harry Potter: Honestly, don't you have better things to do than to stalk an eleven-year-old? And it's just a book.
Severus Snape: First of all, you are a TROUBLEMAKER. I do not tolerate behavior like that! What, do you think you're so cool with your mad Quidditch skills and your little cronies? Think you're above the rules?
Ronald Weasley: Hey! I'm not a cronie! Those are the likes of Crabbe and Goyle. I'm a sidekick!
Severus Snape: SHUT UP, I don't talk to you damn Weasleys! Oh, and I'm confiscating this book.
Harry Potter:Why? It's not like I stole it!
Severus Snape:Because...well...LIBRARY BOOKS AREN'T ALLOWED TO BE TAKEN OUTSIDE THE SCHOOL.
Harry Potter:...You've got to be kidding me. THAT'S the best excuse you can give me? Technically, we're still in school – these are school grounds, correct? I would accept your reason if I were actually outside of Hogwarts, like if I were Hogsmeade or something. This is a blatant lie.
Severus Snape: FIVE POINTS FROM GRYFFINDOR. NOW SHUT UP YOU ARROGANT BASTARD!

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: He's such a pain, he totally made that up. P.S. did you see him limping?
Ronald Weasley: I hope it fucking kills him.
Harry Potter:Well, that's a bit harsh...
Ronald Weasley: I'm serious. I hope it becomes infected, and it slowly destroys him.
Harry Potter: ...Ooookaaaayyy...

Ronald Weasley Together with Harry Potter, we discovered a way to trick Hermione Jean Granger into doing our homework without her realizing!
Hermione Jean Granger: You jerk!
Harry Potter: Ron, you idiot, why did you tag her name?
Ronald Weasley: Oh, whoops. My bad. So, Granger, I have a Potions essay that I need done...I mean checked over. That's what I meant.
Hermione Jean Granger:HOW WILL YOU LEARN?
Harry Potter: Okay, I'm leaving you guys to bicker like an old married couple – I'm going to the staffroom to try to get my book back from Snape. PEACE!
Ronald Weasley: Better you than me!
Hermione Jean Granger:Better you than me!
Harry Potter: Well that was kind of creepy...I got those notifications back-to-back.
Ronald Weasley: NNNNOOOOOOOOOO!
Hermione Jean Granger: Oh, shut up, Ronald! I'm just as concerned as you are, if not more so! This must mean my IQ is dropping at a rapid rate if we managed to think the same thought! NNNNOOOOOOOOOO!

Harry Potter is going to the staffroom to demand his book back. So watch out, Severus Snape! I'm not scared of you! (sent from mobile)
Harry Potter: OH THANK THE LORD – IT SEEMS THE STAFFROOM IS EMPTY. I really did not want a confrontation with a dangerous wizard who is over twenty-years my senior, with considerable more magical experience than me. I think I'm just going to take a peak and see if he left it somewhere –

Argus Filch wrote on Severus Snape's wall: Wow, you totally got recked bad. Why did you wait so long to get it fixed? Madam Pomfrey could've healed you in, like, five seconds!
Severus Snape:I'm going to ignore that legitimate point and complain about the three-headed dog instead! And also check my notifications...

Severus Snape wrote on Harry Potter's wall: POTTER! WHAT THE HELL DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? GET OUT!
Harry Potter: I just wanted my book back...it's a logical reason to come here...
Severus Snape:OUT!

Harry Potter IS RUNNING FOR HIS LIFE! (sent from mobile)

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Well, did you get it back?
Harry Potter: Does it LOOK like I have anything with me? OF COURSE NOT! But I just saw some freaky stuff down in the staffroom. I'm going to explain it to you in person because this is a serious accusation and I don't want everyone knowing about it.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: SO YOU THINK SNAPE TRIED TO GET PAST THAT THREE-HEADED DOG ON HALLOWEEN TO GET THE MYSTERIOUS OBJECT THAT THE MONSTER IS GUARDING? AND YOU BET YOUR BROOMSTICK THAT HE LET THE TROLL IN AS A DIVERSION?
Harry Potter: Oh my god, Ron, you imbecile! You're like an improperly trained dog! dirting on the rug even after you're deliberately told not to! Come here and let me rub your nose in your own droppings! 
Hermione Jean Granger: There's no way a teacher would be so evil! Besides, you would think Dumbledore would know when a teacher is a shifty character...
Ronald Weasley: Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something?
Hermione Jean Granger:PRETTY CLOSE.

Harry Potter is rather nervous for the Quidditch match tomorrow! And can't get Severus Snape's disturbing face out of his mind.

Harry Potter and 1,070 others are attending FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!

Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: You should really eat something. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day! It jumpstarts your metabolism, and gives you physical and mental strength to prepare you for the day!
Harry Potter: Hermione, please, shut up. I feel like I'm about to upchuck my last twenty meals I'm so nervous.
Seamus Finnigan: The Know-It-All is right, Harry, you do need your strength. Seekers are always the ones who get clobbered by the other team.
Harry Potter: Wow, that was kind of douchey, Seamus.
Seamus Finnigan: No probs! Can you pass the ketchup?
Hermione Jean Granger: Just a bit of toast, Harry?
Harry Potter:GO AWAY!

Lee Jordan wrote on FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!'s wall: Sorry, Professor! Anyway, she passes it to Alicia Spinnet, who was only a reserve last year, but Wood seems to deem her worthy now...IF YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. And don't try to correct me! Because she just blatantly threw the Quaffle to Marcus Flint! Talk of untalented. Honestly, Wood, keep your sexual escapades SEPARATE from Quidditch!

Katie Bell now has possession, now that Gryffindor Chaser has a ton of talent, but too bad she's not as sexyfine as Angelina. OH! Hit in the back of the head! Hopefully that cracking noise was just someone's knuckles and not her neck! Now Adrian Pucey of Slytherin is in possession, but a Bludger, sent by one of the Weasley Twins, attacks him. Can't tell which one. Doesn't matter, because Sexy Angie now has the Quaffle again...AND SHE SCORES! 10 POINTS TO GRYFFINDOR, WHAT WHAT!

Ronald Weasley: Of course it's all about Harry-freaking-Potter.
Rubeus Hagrid: Well, he IS playing in his first-even Quidditch match at the moment. Geez, sometimes I think Snape should worry about your ego instead. Has there been a Snitch-Chasing scene yet?
Ronald Weasley: No. Harry hasn't done jack-shit.
Rubeus Hagrid: Keeping out of trouble, that's something you don't see everyday from Harry Potter!

Harry Potter I'm about to lose my street cred! Have to find this Snitch! I can't be staying out of trouble forever! (sent from mobile)
Oliver Wood:NO! You have to keep out of the way until you actually SEE the Snitch. You're on the top of Slytherin's hit list! This was our plan!

Rolanda Hooch wrote on FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!'s wall: Don't worry y'all, Gryffindor's getting a free shot.

Dean Thomas wrote on Rolanda Hooch's wall: SEND HIM OFF, REF. RED CARD!
Ronald Weasley: WTF are you going on about?
Hermione Jean Granger: A red card is used in football when a player commits a serious foul and is sent off, and required to leave the field of play and must take no further part in the remainder of the game. The player who has been sent off cannot be replaced during the game; the team must continue the game with one player fewer.
Dean Thomas:I was going to explain it, Granger...
Ronald Weasley: Yeah, just ignore her. But while that is a good idea, there's one flaw: THIS ISN'T FOOTBALL.
Rubeus Hagrid: They really should change the rules, though. Flint could've easily knocked Harry off his broom, and he could've met his inescapable death. This may sound crazy, but I think that warrants something other than a free shot.
Rolanda Hooch: STOP CONVERSING ON MY WALL, DAMN IT. I'M IN THE MIDDLE OF REFFING A GAME.

Lee Jordan wrote on FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!'s wall: So, that was quite an obvious and disgusting piece of cheating...

Minerva McGonagall wrote on FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!'s wall: DELETING. AGAIN. I'M WARNING YOU, BOY...
Lee Jordan wrote on FIRST QUIDDITCH MATCH OF THE YEAR!'s wall: Fine. Flint nearly kills the Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen to anyone, I'm sure, so a penalty to Gryffindor is taken by Spinnet. Oh Merlin...hopefully she'll make this because then it'll just be glaringly obvious that she's having sexual relations with Wood just to be on the bloody team. Oh! What a surprise! She makes it!

Harry Potter: The bastard!
Rubeus Hagrid: That's rubbish! Why would Snape do something like that?
Harry Potter: Well, let's start with the fact that he was trying to get past that three-headed dog on Halloween – he's trying to steal whatever that monster is hiding. Good thing he got bit. Karma for you right there.

Do NOT mess with me when it comes to knowledge. I AM ALWAYS RIGHT.
Rubeus Hagrid: Calm down, Hermione. I'm so much older than you, so I have something that you DON'T have – WISDOM. Yeah, that's right. Can't learn about that in any goddamn book! Now, I've known Snape for years, and he would never try to kill a student. But getting back to the discussion at hand, just try and forget everything you ever saw, because all of this is none of your business. It only concerns Professor Dumbledore and Nicolas Flamel.

Ahem.Harry Potter wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team '91-'92's wall: Thanks, everybody ^_^Draco Malfoy left the group Gryffindor Quidditch Team '91-'92.Draco Malfoy is back to taunting Harry Potter about the fact that he does not have a proper family. Again, if nobody realized yet, I am a dick.Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Don't worry, bud. Mum and Dad are visiting Charlie in Romania, so my brothers and I are staying at Hogwarts, too! Don't let Malfoy get to you.Harry Potter:Yay! Besties for life.Dudley Dursley:I'm ECSTATIC that you aren't coming home. MORE PRESENTS FOR DUDDERS :-DHarry Potter:I'd love to know when I ever, EVER, took presents away from you.Dudley Dursley:Maybe *I* might enjoy a pair of my father's old, dirty socks one Christmas – never thought of that did you, you selfish bastard?Harry Potter:Oh my god, I am going to treat you just as I have learned to treat Malfoy and his cronies: as invisible. I am rubber and you are glue.Dudley Dursley:I'M NOT GLUE! WTF? YOU WILL DIE FOR THAT.Harry Potter:Really? Do you have ANYTHING floating around that giant cranium of yours?Severus Snape:Do YOU, Potter?Dudley Dursley:Touché, Snapey.Severus Snape:Do NOT call me..."Snapey."Hermione Jean Granger:When Harry referred to you as glue, Dudley, he was referring to the famous rhyme, that I will type out fully here for your literary pleasure: "I am rubber and you are glue, whatever you say bounces off of me, and sticks to you." It means that he is aware of your insults, and aware of the fact that they will eventually come back to burn you in the end, when they are stuck to you and you cannot escape the pain that you have inflicted on him. You will live a very sad, lonely life because you are so miserably rude to everyone around you.Dudley Dursley:NO ONE ASKED YOU!Vernon Dursley just found his only son, Dudley Dursley, crying in the corner of his room, muttering something about "a girl from Harry's magic school."

WHAT IS GOING ON? YOU THINK YOU CAN JUST GRAB AT MALFOY'S ROBES? YOU ARE FILTH.Rubeus Hagrid:He was provoked!Harry Potter:Yes, Professor, he was. Malfoy was insulting his family!Severus Snape:Oh-ho! Look at the biiiiig time CELEBRITY, coming out to defend the FILTH that wanders these halls...WOW, you must think you're reaaaally something, huh, Potter? You're big man on campus, aren't you? Oooh look at me, I'm Harry Potter, I have a lightening scar, and therefore, you can all bow down to my greatness!Harry Potter:This hardly seems like a fair assessment of my character...as usual...Severus Snape:Five points from Gryffindor. Be grateful it's not more!Harry Potter:I mean, I'm not going to be grateful for that...we were only awarded five points for beating down a GIGANTIC mountain troll OURSELVES. I'm not exactly surprised anymore by Hogwarts' corrupted point system.Severus Snape:Arrogant piece of...MOVE ALONG!Ronald Weasley swears on all that he owns that he WILL get Malfoy one day!

Let's go to see the Great Hall – it looks super duper awesome and pretty & all.Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry:OMG, that's so nice of you to say!

Thank you so much. I do, like, really try though. So I mean...it's not like I just end up this way because everybody's decorating me. Like, I put a lot of effort into it and stuff.

Ronald Weasley:Fuck that shit!Harry Potter:Um, no, Ron...remember? We're researching Nicolas Flamel...keep it on the DL around Hagrid!Rubeus Hagrid:I don't understand why you keep talking about me through Facebook. It's not even that you talk about me, it's that you do it in a public forum and it comes up on my news feed and it hurts my feelings...AND I told you to DROP IT! It's none of your business what that dog's guarding!Harry Potter:Hagrid, I'm sorry, but this is the reason we try to keep things from you. You're being SO lame. Why don't you just tell us and save us the trouble of going to the library – it's SO boring!Rubeus Hagrid:My lips are sealed!Harry Potter:SINCE WHEN? You can't just pretend your lips are sealed and then give away PARTS of valuable information.Rubeus Hagrid:I'll do whatever I damn well please, ya nosy whipper-snappers.Harry Potter added "Nicolas Flamel" to their interests.(Hermione Jean Granger and Ronald Weasley like this.)Harry Potter Ugh, the library is so big.

My dumbass magical cousin is making fun of my girth again – as usual. Dad seemed to care about my tears for a while the other night but the only time he ever tried to talk to me was to tell me I better make him a cup of tea! Ugh, everyone thinks Harry is SO awesome – it's always poor little Harry this, poor little orphaned Harry that...he hasn't got a family, he had to sleep in a cupboard, boo-hoo-hoo! What about ME? It HURTS to be called fat!Harry Potter added "Wizard Chess" to their interests.(Ronald Weasley likes this.)Harry Potter well, it's Christmas Eve. I'm pretty excited for Christmas – not expecting much in the way of gifts, though. Don't get me wrong, though, no gifts are better than the shit the Dursleys got me.Dudley Dursley:You are so ungrateful.Draco Malfoy:Srsly.Harry Potter:Malfoy, are you for real? You are the most ungrateful thing I have ever had the misfortune of meeting. You have all the money in the world and yet you're a greedy and bitter! Same goes for you, DUDDERS, you get everything that you could ever desire.Draco Malfoy:Wow, whoever uttered the phrase "Christmas Spirit" never met this douche bag, right Dud?Dudley Dursley:LMAO :P So right.Draco Malfoy:Still coming over for Christmas dinner?Dudley Dursley:Of course!

It sounds like an owl!Rubeus Hagrid:Um...it was supposed to be a spoon, but whatever.Harry Potter:Why...would you give me a...spoon? For Christmas...?Rubeus Hagrid:Well, why would I give you a flute? What am I a musician?Harry Potter:No...what? I'm so confused. Why would you whittle me a wooden spoon? First of all, it has holes in it...and the end is totally shallow - it's not going to hold anything! And it could give me splinters!Rubeus Hagrid:Oh my god. You really are ungrateful, aren't you! Dudley was right.Harry Potter:I'm sorry, Hagrid. It's a really nice spoon.Rubeus Hagrid:Yeah, yeah.Harry Potter wrote on Vernon Dursley's wall: Hello. Thank you for the 50-pence piece. It has truly made a HUGE difference in my life...you know, considering the fact that I could totally use it to purchase something useful like...a piece of GUM, I suppose, if I didn't go to MAGIC SCHOOL and could only use MAGIC MONEY HERE.Vernon Weasley:We actually spent 50 pence of our hard-earned money on you. Dudley was right!Dudley Dursley:Omg, thanks dad!Vernon Weasley: Get ready, boy, we're off to the Malfoy's.Dudley Dursley:YAY!Harry Potter sent Ronald Weasley a fifty pence-piece.Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: *groan* I think Mum made you a Weasley sweater...embarrassing.Harry Potter:Holy cow!

I also don't understand when we became friends.The Fat Lady:I hacked onto your page and accepted my request that had been sitting idly by for months, you little brat!Harry Potter:I knew it!

I have my own thoughts on whom it might be...Severus Snape:Gonna stop you right there, Filch, mainly because I don't care who you've conjured up in that rickety old mind of yours. *I* personally know EXACTLY who this is.Argus Filch:Pretty sure we're thinking of the same person.Severus Snape:NO FAIR! I thought of him first!Argus Filch:Why do you have it in for Potter so badly? I mean...I hate everyone pretty much equally. But you're frighteningly obsessive.Severus Snape:Shut up. He's such an entitled piece of good-for-nothing brat!Argus Filch:Um...okay, well, I honestly hate everyone. Like, more than you could even ever understand. And as much as he's freaking me out, as he must have found a way to turn invisible, he's actually not that bad. He's totally grateful and shit.Severus Snape:He thinks he's a celebrity! He's just like his damn father.Argus Filch:Oooohh, I get it now.Severus Snape:What?Argus Filch:No, nothing, I just...I totally get it now. Mrs. Norris told me you were harboring pent-up feelings against Harry's father and the fact that he stole Lily Evans from your dirty little fingers but I always said that was preposterous. Now it all makes sense...Severus Snape:...damn.Harry PotterAHA! And Potter makes a narrow escape, as usual! Oh wow, is that a mirror? Gotta check mah face.

And then there's a black-haired man with glasses just like mine. His hair is untidy – JUST LIKE MINE!Ronald Weasley:Harry, those sound like your fucking parents. Are you shitting me right now?

I'm looking at my entire family tree in this creepy mirror!Ronald Weasley:Not understanding how that second statement disproves the first statement that you're not on drugs.Harry Potter:Wow, you're sort of snotty when you're tired, man.Ronald Weasley:Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, dude.

You can't just sneak up on people like that, man.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you. Heh heh.Harry Potter:Um...yeah.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:So, looks like you've found the Mirror of ErisedHarry Potter:You mean the Mirror of Unfading Happiness and Rainbows...lalala...?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Whatever gets you through the day...I expect you've realized by now what it does?Harry Potter:Um, yeah...I'm not that stupid. It shows me my dead family.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Yes, but it showed your friend Ron himself as Head Boy.Harry Potter:How - ?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:I don't require a cloak to become invisible. I'm kind of legit like that.Harry Potter:That's  creepy. You've been spying on me? I bet you're one of those that like, peeps on people in the bathroom and stuff.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Can you think of what the Mirror of Erised shows us all?Harry Potter:We're not in History of Magic class. Move it along please.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:It shows us nothing more or less than the deepest, most desperate desire of our hearts. This mirror will give us neither knowledge nor truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.Harry Potter:Have you been rehearsing this? Obviously I know what I see isn't real, gramps, my parents are dead. You can stop talking to me like I'm three-years-old, this is the big league now. Just allow me to take this up into my room so I can lock myself in there for all eternity and have a tea-party with my dead parents forever and ever and ever and we all never die and we all are so super happy together and life is wonderful and everything is like apple pie. Forever.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Yeaaaah...I saw this coming. The Mirror will be moved to a new home tomorrow. DO NOT go looking for it again. This is what we call "cold turkey" in the biz.Harry Potter: NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! GIVE ME MY DEAD PARENTS! I WANT TO HAVE A TEA PARTY WITH MY DEAD PARENTS! NOW NOW NOW NOW NOW! I WANT TO RIGHT NOW!Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:You are in the midst of a tantrum. It does not do to dwell on dreams and forget to live. Now put on the cloak and go to bed.Harry Potter:Well, well, aren't you just a ray of sunshine? You have about as much sensitivity as Ron does. You mind that I ask you a question, SIR, considering the fact that you've just taken all of my dreams and stamped them out on the floor, being the horrible ass that you are?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Well, you've just asked me a question. But I suppose you can ask one more.Harry Potter:Right. After everything, you still have to be horrid. What do you see when you look in the mirror?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:I see myself holding a pair of thick, woolen socks.Harry Potter: As if, not talking to you anymore.Harry Potter wonders what Dumbledore ACTUALLY sees when he looks in the mirror. Perhaps himself and his ultimate gay lover?(Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore likes this.)Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Right you are, Harry. So right you are. Can't find a good man these days!Harry Potter:Oh...really? Hm...that explains the top-notch fashion sense.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Yes, I've been wondering about you, Harry...Harry Potter:Yeah, I know, everyone thinks that I'm gay.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Um...I wasn't wondering that at all, actually. But...that is strange that your mind immediately went to that...very interesting.Harry Potter:Aw, come on! I walked right into that, I guess.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:You and Ronald make a very nice couple ^_^Harry Potter:*Sigh*

Harry Potter Mirror withdrawal SUCKS. I keep having the worst nightmares EVER.
Ronald Weasley: Dumbledore was right, man, you should've stopped ages ago. You wouldn't have to go through this if you had just listened to me.
Harry Potter: I DON'T NEED THIS RIGHT NOW.
Hermione Jean Granger: Do you mean to tell me that you found ABSOLUTELY NOTHING about Flamel during our two weeks off? And you were out of bed AFTER HOURS? P.S. I'm going to completely ignore the fact that you discovered such a rare object of magic and saw your family for the first time in your life.

Oliver Wood wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: I'M GONNA WORK YOU PEPS TO DA GROUND!
Fred Weasley wrote on Oliver Wood's wall: You're a fanatic! Calm down!
(Fred Weasley, George Weasley and 3 others like this.)
George Weasley: There's absolutely no reason for this.
Harry Potter: I disagree completely. I rather like training hours at a time in the worst elements possible. Keep up the great captain-ing, Oliver!
Fred Weasley: TRAITOR!
Harry Potter: Well SORRY that whenever we have a hard practice, I'm able to go through my withdrawal better!

Oliver Wood wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: YOU GUYS BETTER GET YOUR ACT TOGETHER – SNAPE IS GOING TO REF THE NEXT GAME! WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE RETARDED!
George Weasley wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: Give us that kind of devastating news when we're NOT hovering in the air! I almost fell off my broom! How the hell is this fair? And since when do professors ref Quidditch games?
Oliver Wood wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: It's an option that will only be available for the rest of this term. It sucks, but we just have to play fair, and give Snape no reason take away points.
Harry Potter wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: Okay, guys, we're doomed. I'm sorry, but Snape hates my guts. I did absolutely nothing to him, but he treats me like I took away the source of his happiness and snuffed it out while I cackled in his face.
Oliver Wood wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: ...well shite.

Ronald Weasley added "crushing Hermione in chess" to their interests.
Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Hey, mate, what's the matter? Let's try and turn that frown upside down! Like so: :( - :)
Harry Potter: It seems Snape, who really does not look like he has ever flown a day in his life, has now decided to follow his dream of becoming a Quidditch ref.
Hermione Jean Granger: Don't play. Problem solved. Honestly, am I the only one who THINKS around here?
Ronald Weasley: He can't just NOT play, Hermione. He'll look like a pussy. You have to give a legit excuse. Say you're sick.
Hermione Jean Granger: That's the dumbest idea EVER. You can easily get better with Madam Pomfrey! Here's a better suggestion: pretend to break your leg.
Ronald Weasley: Are you for real, Granger? REALLY BREAK YOUR LEG!
Harry Potter: I can't! There isn't a reserve Seeker. In fact, I don't think we even have reserves at all – Spinnet was apparently the last one, and now she's on the team. Merlin knows why *coughSHE'SSLEEPINGWITHWOOD*cough*

Neville Longbottom thinks Hogwarts kids are a bunch of snotty brats– who doesn't help a poor First Year hit with a Leg-Locker Curse? I had to hop all the way to the Gryffindor tower as hundreds of students (and some professors!) pointed and laughed at me. 
Hermione Jean Granger: I'll help you, Neville! Then you'll have to be my friend!
Neville Longbottom: Oh, great.
Hermione Jean Granger: Who was dickish enough to do such a terrible thing?
Neville Longbottom: Malfoy, obvi. He wanted to practice on a human subject.
Hermione Jean Granger: Report to McGonagall!
Ronald Weasley: So then he can be known as a stool pigeon? God, Hermione, this kid has enough problems. AND NEVILLE, IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHAT STOOL PIGEON MEANS, DON'T ASK. DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
Neville Longbottom:But I really am quite curious.
Hermione Jean Granger: A "stool pigeon" is a slang term that's synonymous with "snitch," or "rat."
Ronald Weasley: Wow, Hermione, I'm surprised you didn't go into a long-winded speech about its first usage and other such useless information.
Hermione Jean Granger: Yes, well, I suppose I'm getting a little more tolerable.
Ronald Weasley: INCONCEIVABLE! But srsly, Neville, you can't just take that shit lying down. Stand up for yourself! Stop being an embarrassment to the Gryffindor House!

Harry Potter sent Neville Longbottom a Chocolate Frog.
Harry Potter wrote on Neville Longbottom's wall: Don't listen to Malfoy. He's a loser; you're worth twelve of him. There's a reason why the Sorting Hat chose you for Gryffindor. I, personally, don't have a clue, but I'm sure it will be revealed in time.
Neville Longbottom: Thanks, Harry, you cheered me right up.
Neville Longbottom sent Harry Potter a Chocolate Frog Trading Card.

Harry Potter OMG THANK YOU Neville Longbottom! Hermione Jean Granger and Ronald Weasley: I FOUND FLAMEL! HE USED TO WORK WITH DUMBLEDORE IN ALCHEMY!
Ronald Weasley; What a stroke of luck that out of the thousands of collectable cards, you've managed to get the exact one you need! WHY MUST YOUR LIFE BE PERFECT?
Hermione Jean Granger: This is more exciting than getting back my first piece of homework! BRB.
Ronald Weasey sent Harry Potter a mystified look.
Harry Potter sent Ronald Weasley a mystified look.
Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: How could I be so stupid! I never thought to look in this book! I got this book out of the library weeks ago for a bit of light reading! It solves everything!
Ronald Weasley: Are you fucking kidding, Hermione? Why are we friends again?
Hermione Jean Granger: Shut up I'm researching!
Ronald Weasley: ...Can we talk NOW? We've been watching you mutter to yourself for the past forty-five minutes!
Hermione Jean Granger: FOUND IT: Nicolas Flamel is the only known maker of the Sorcerer's Stone! THIS EXPLAINS EVERYTHING.
Harry Potter: ...Huh?
Ronald Weasley: What?
Hermione Jean Granger: HONESTLY, don't you two READ?
Ronald Weasley: We haven't read in months – ever since you started doing our homework, I haven't touched a textbook since.
Harry Potter: That's not true, Ron! We read Nasty Witches.
Ronald Weasley: True dat. See, Hermione, we DO read.
Hermione Jean Granger: Sometimes I wonder why I try so hard to be your friends...

Hermione Jean Granger sent Harry Potter and Ronald Weasley a piece of text from an extremely old and large textbook.
Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: That beast of a creature must be guarding Flamel's stone! Since Flamel and Dumbledore are biffles, Flamel must've asked Dumbledore to keep the stone safe since he must've known someone was after it! It all makes sense!
Harry Potter: Whoa, this stone sounds pretty sweet: it makes gold and stops people from dying. Everyone in the world must want this.
Ronald Weasley: And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel in that "Study of Recent Developments in Wizardry" – he's not exactly recent if he's 665, is he?
Hermione Jean Granger:...That doesn't even warrant a response.
Ronald Weasley: Technically, you did respond to me :P
Hermione Jean Granger:ARGH!

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: If I had a Sorcerer's Stone, I would def make a bitchload of goal and buy my own Quidditch team.
Harry Potter: Oh no, that reminds me about the upcoming game with Snape! But you know what, I'm just going to play. I can't let the Slytherins think I'm scared. I'll show them...it'll really wipe the smiles off their faces if we win.
Hermione Jean Granger: Just as long as we're not wiping you off the field.
Harry Potter: ...That was so morbid, Hermione.
Ronald Weasley: CAN WE, FOR ONCE, FOCUS ON ME? WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF DISCUSSING WHAT WE WERE GOING TO DO WITH THE SORCERER'S STONE, AND OF COURSE, WHEN IT'S MY TURN, WE HAVE TO TALK ABOUT SOMETHING ELSE. FUCK YOU GUYS!
Harry Potter: So, yeah, Hermione, can I copy your notes on werewolf bites later?

Harry Potter is really nervous about this match!
Oliver Wood: We all are, mate! This is SERIOUS. The idea of ending the Slytherin seven-year winning streak literally makes me jizz in my pants.
Harry Potter: TMI, Oliver.
Alicia Spinnet: Oh, so you'll get hot and bothered by the fantasy of winning the House Cup, but you'll barely bat an eye when your lover tries to seduce you? HOW DARE YOU.
Oliver Wood: You know I'm really attracted to you, Alicia! It's just...Quidditch right now is more important, I'm sorry!
Harry Potter: Can you not have this conversation on my status? I'm eleven-years-old, you know. Still innocent. Kthx.

Harry Potter feels like Severus Snape is stalking him. Honestly, why does this man have such a hard-on for me?
Severus Snape: Oh, so you just think that because I try and bump into you in the corridors between all your classes and I constantly torture you in class, I MUST be obsessed with you? Potter, you could not be more obnoxious.
Harry Potter: *Sigh* I suppose I set myself up for that one...

Harry Potter wonders if Severus Snape can maybe read minds...
(Severus Snape likes this.)
Severus Snape: Yes, Potter, be VERY afraid. I have access to your entire head, which is always full of thoughts about how awesome you are, even though in reality, you're a piece of good-for-nothing brat. DON'T DENY IT.
Harry Potter: If you could really read minds, you would know that I think it's complete stupid that such a biased referee will be used in the upcoming match, and that I've been thinking about the Sorcerer's Stone. AM I IN ANY OF THOSE THOUGHTS? NO.
Severus Snape: I know exactly what you're thinking now! HAH.
Harry Potter: DAMN IT. That was rather stupid of me. But I still think you can maybe read minds. Note this status, Facebookers! It may mean something in the future!

Ronald Weasley wrote on Draco Malfoy's wall: What the hell do you want, Malfoy?
Draco Malfoy:Well, Crabbe and Goyle and I were wondering how long Potter is going to last on his broom this time. Want to bet? You could use some money, Poorsley.
Ronald Weasley: Okay, there are many things in your response that I must pick apart. First: Crabbe and Goyle do not use their brains, under any circumstances, so that makes no fucking sense. Second: Harry almost falling to his death during the last match was clearly not reflective of his flying skillz – his broom was clearly being jinxed. Third: YOU USED THAT STUPID-ASS PUN A SECOND TIME?

Draco Malfoy wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: You know how I think they choose people for the Gryffindor team? It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's the Weasleys, who've got no money – you should be on the team, Longbottom, you've got no brains. HAR HAR, I'm so clever. And a dick.
Neville Longbottom: I'm worth twelve of you, Malfoy!
Harry Potter: Even though I'm in the middle of a Quidditch game, I would just like to point out that this is a rather sweet moment – Neville actually taking what I said and applying it! Adorable. 'Kay, continue!
Draco Malfoy: LOL.
Ronald Weasley: You tell him, Neville!
Draco Malfoy: Longbottom, if brains were gold, you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.
Ronald Weasley: Don't you have anything better to do than to bother us? If you say one more word to me, I'm literally going to have to kick your ass.

Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: RON! Sorry to break up your pointless testosterone-filled threatening, but look at Harry!
Ronald Weasley: Err...Hermione? Why are you crossing your fingers in your mouth? That's rather odd...
Hermione Jean Granger: I'M REALLY CONCERNED ABOUT HARRY, OKAY? YOU SHOULD BE DOING THE SAME.
Ronald Weasley: I'm not sticking my fingers in my mouth. I doubt having crossed fingers in my mouth will increase Harry's luck.
Draco Malfoy: Did you see Potter dive? You're luck must be increasing instead: Potter's obviously spotted some money on the ground.
Ronald Weasley: THAT'S IT, YOUR ASS IS MINE, BITCH.

Anyway, everyone's partying in the common room – Fred and George stole some food from the kitchens. Let's go!
Harry Potter:Shhhhhhh, I need to tell you guys something that's actually important!
Harry Potter: We were SO right about the Sorcerer's Stone being in the school, and now Snape is trying to use Quirrell to steal it. Probably needs the poor guy to break through some spells, even though I seriously doubt Quirrell's capability on that – I haven't learned a damn thing in DADA all year...
Hermione Jean Granger: So let me get this straight...you mean the Stone's only safe as long as Quirrell stands up to Snape?

Harry Potter:And I'm ending this disgusting display of sexual tension...NOW.

Hermione Jean Granger:GASP!
Harry Potter:Sorry I even brought that up, I didn't realize it would only fuel your arguments...as I was TRYING to say...Hagrid has always wanted a dragon – he told me so the first time I ever met him!
Ronald Weasley:Yeah, but it's against our laws. It was outlawed by the Warlocks' Convention of 1709. Everybody knows that.
Harry Potter:Well la-dee-da! If I hadn't mentioned it a thousand times ALREADY, I was unaware of magic until a month before fucking school started!
Hermione Jean Granger:Wow, Ron...that was actually really impressive. I can't believe you remembered specific information like that...

Hermione Jean Granger:Come oooon, Haggy. You might not wanna tell uuuss, but you dooo know eveeeerything that goes on round here! We only wondered who had done the guarding, reaaally. We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough to help him, apart from yooouu of course!

Harry Potter:SNAPE?
Rubeus Hagrid:Yeah, Harry. Calm down. How are you STILL on about that? Snape helped PROTECT the stone.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: It's so obvious that Snape would get involved with guarding the Stone just so he could find out how the other teachers charmed it – he probably knows everything! He's the perfect candidate to break in.

Harry Potter wrote on Rubeus Hagrid's wall: You're the only one who knows how to get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid? And you wouldn't tell anyone, WOULD YOU?
Ronald Weasley:Harry, is this a serious question? Hagrid always ends up telling us everything we need to know. He would tell a psychotic homeless man who stumbled up to his hut.

Norbert the Dragon:Wow, I am just completely surrounded by GENIUSES! Yeah, that really makes me feel a whole lot better, Four-Eyes. The only way that would make me feel better is if your lack of a mother would somehow give me back mine! How does us BOTH not having mothers help ANYTHING?

Rubeus Hagrid:I knoooowwww! *sobs* But I don't know what to doooooo!
Norbert the Dragon:Yep, life's great. I've got a big fat giant crying over me while I continue to GROW, something everybody talks about as if I can HELP...then I got Four-Eyes over here blessing me with his life story. 

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: WAIT! Charlie!
Ronald Weasley:Me Ron! Losing it, Harry?
Harry Potter:NO! Charlie – in Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert to him. He can take care of him till he's ready to go back into the wild!
Ronald Weasley:Brilliant! How about it Hagrid?
Rubeus Hagrid:*sniffle* I guess so...
Norbert the Dragon:Great. Now you're sending me to somebody who sounds even less like my mother. Charlie in Romania? Ugh. I guess anything's better than this place. Please, get rid of me soon I'm about to tear this place up and eat the lot of you. All this guy gives me is chicken blood and brandy. I've been drunk and I'm not even a month old! Someone call child protective services.
Ronald Weasley:Hey, treat us with a little respect, punk.
Norbert the Dragon:When I begin my reign of terror on this hut, you will be the first to go, Ginger.

Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Hey, whatcha doin' in the common room all by yourself, Harry?
Ronald Weasley:He's waiting for me...I was at Hagrid's helping to feed the bastard child.
Hermione Jean Granger:That's extremely dangerous, Ronald.
Ronald Weasley:You're telling me? I got bit by the little punk-ass bitch. And Hagrid did NOTHING in the way of reprimanding it – he sang it a lullaby!
Norbert the Dragon:That's right, I got that oaf wrapped around my little claw. Deal with it. And your flesh tastes like CRAP. I guess that's what poor tastes like ha.
Draco Malfoy:lololol! Schooled by a dragon, Poorsley!
Norbert the Dragon:Is that...is that supposed to be a pun on his last name? Weasley, you let this kind of people make fun of you? Wow, you really are more pathetic than even I thought you were.
Ronald Weasley:Omg, you're so fucking mean! I can't wait until you leave!
Norbert the Dragon:Cry all you want. One day I'm gonna grow up reaaal big and strong and I'm gonna come and crush you & your family. Sleep with one eye open.

Ronald Weasley:STFU, he schooled you, too.

Hedwig the Owl wrote on Harry Potter's wall: If you don't mind, I'd appreciate if you got a little less mail. When the big man bought me that fateful day, he assured me that you were alone in the world and would rarely receive any mail. So what is this? He's sending you mail, this redhead from Romania is sending you mail... I'm fully aware that you get NOTHING, but The Troll and I are busy!
Harry Potter:Yeah, yeah, yeah.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: Charlie says he'll take Norbert! We have to get Norbert to the tallest tower at midnight on Saturday...
Norbert the Dragon:Ha ha ha, good luck with that, suckers!
Ronald Weasley:Ugh. Don't you want to leave!
Norbert the Dragon:Yes, but what I want more than anything is to be the biggest pain in the ass you've ever encountered. And that's saying something, because I know you hang out with that bushy-haired girl.
Hermione Jean Granger:Excuse me!
Ronald Weasley:lololol! You know, you're alright, Norbert! Maybe we can be friends after all. High five!

Harry Potter How could we be so stupid to leave the cloak in the tower? HERMIONE – What were you doing? I thought you had brains! (sent from mobile)
Hermione Jean Granger: I'm sorry, Harry! I was considering the improbable possibility of Malfoy and I having relations, which brought about the OOC moment! _ Never again!
Ronald Weasley:WHAT? You and Malfoy? That makes me want to act like an asshole and have considerable rage.
Harry Potter: That's not totally OOC of you...let's be honest here.
Ronald Weasley: True, but I'll take it one step further, making me seem like a caricature with no dimensions.
Minerva McGonagall:Quiet– you're in the process of being in deep trouble and shall be punished... - in a nonsexual way.
Harry Potter: Why you had to clarify that statement scares me.

Harry Potter wrote on Neville Longbottom's wall: Neville! Why is McGonagall dragging you by the collar?
Neville Longbottom: Harry! I was trying to find you to warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going to catch you, he said you had a drag
Ronald Weasley: Why you thought taking his phone would help, Harry, is beyond me; it didn't work for Hagrid. It's pretty damn obvious what Neville was going to write out. Now McGonagall is just going to be more pissed that you left your chair.
Harry Potter: Things cannot get any worse.
Dudley Dursley: HARHAR Pottyhead's in twouble!
Harry Potter: I stand corrected. 
Minerva McGonagall : That's right, Potter.

Minerva McGonagall I never would've believed you would go up to the astronomy tower at one o'clock in the morning. Don't know why, especially since Weasley and Potter are related to the most infamous pranksters Hogwarts has ever seen, and Granger would do just about anything to please these buffoons so they would tolerate her. Same goes with Longbottom. Regardless, EXPLAIN YOURSELVES.
Hermione Jean Granger: Maybe if I stare at my slippers long enough, I will turn invisible.
McGonagall: You're still here, and get ready to enter the house of pain, FELINE STYLE. You guys don't even have to explain yourselves because I clearly know what happened: you told Malfoy some story about a dragon, trying to get him into trouble. Good for you, your plan worked, and he was caught. But I bet you didn't plan on Lonbottom hearing the story and believing it, too, HUH? You guys messed up. BIG TIME.

Harry Potter sent Neville Longbottom a look without words that will explain everything.
Neville Longbottom wrote on Harry Potter's wall: I DON'T GET IT, BUT IT DOESN'T MATTER BECAUSE I HATE YOU!
Harry Potter: Ugh, Neville, please, McGonagall's explanation would make sense if she were talking about Malfoy. You've known me before everyone else! You were the first person to comment on my blog!
Neville Longbottom: How can I trust you? Maybe all those things you wrote were just a bunch of LIES.
Harry Potter: *GASP* You're actually QUESTIONING my place among children tortured since their first day of being orphaned?
Neville Longbottom:Well, if the lying pants FIT.
Harry Potter: You know what, fine, believe what you want. I don't care.
Harry Potter and Neville Longbottom are no longer friends.

Minerva McGonagall I'm absolutely DISGUSTED. Four students out of bed in one night! I've never heard of such a thing before! (In this scene, I'm totally disregarding the fact that the Marauders ever existed, in case you couldn't tell). Granger – I thought you actually sense. Potter – I thought Gryffindor, and being away from your awful Muggle relatives meant more to you than this.
Hermione Jean Granger:I DO HAVE SENSE, I SWEAR, PROFESSOR MCGONAGALL! I MENTIONED BEFORE THAT THIS WAS VERY OOC OF ME. I'LL REGRET IT FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE. PLEASE, GO EASY ON ME!
Harry Potter: Hermione, please, stop your sniveling. It's not going to get you anywhere. Professor McGonagall - I'LL DO ANYTHING, JUST DON'T SEND ME BACK TO THE DURSLEYS. THEY'RE HELL ON EARTH!
Hermione Jean Granger:...
Minerva McGonagall: Everyone just be quiet. All of you are getting detentions, including you, Longbottom. NOTHING gives you the right to walk around school at night, especially these days; it's very dangerous.
Harry Potter: You know, to the average student, like Neville, they don't understand what we're saying. Are you saying that on purpose because you KNOW Hermione and I know more than the average student?

Harry Potter now believes Minerva McGonagall can maybe read minds as well. (sent from mobile)
Minerva McGonagall: I'm flattered you think so highly of my mental capabilities, which are infinitely higher than yours, but I'm in the middle of punishing you right now. So put your phone away so WE CAN MOVE ON.
Minerva McGonagall: I'm taking away fifty points from Gryffindor.
Harry Potter: FIFTY? WHAAAA? Do you NOT want your house to win the cup this year? I sweated blood for those points in the last Quidditch match!
Minerva McGonagall: I didn't finish my statement, Potter: Fifty points EACH.
Hermione Jean Granger: Even I think that's a bit excessive...
 Harry Potter: YOU CAN'T!
Minerva McGonagall: Don't tell me what I can and can't do! Now get back to your dormitories and wallow in your shame! And get ready for the entire school to hate your guts – I will not stop anyone from making your lives living hells.

Harry Potter Gryffindor lost 150 points and is now in last place. How do you recover from this blow?
Hermione Jean Granger: You can't. Trust me, I've been planning for the past three hours. We're royally screwed.

Hedwig The Owl: Sorry, but I'm catching a lot of shit up in the owlery. Quite literally. It's disgusting. You're going to have to give me a bath ASAP.
Harry Potter: Why don't you ask The Troll to do it for you? P.S. I just vomited in my mouth...
Hedwig The Owl: You think the entire school alone hates you? You're even dumber than I thought. The Troll hates me by association. So THANKS A LOT. I'm going to make things even more difficult for you.

Harry Potter: Hey, Ron?
Ronald Weasley: Yeah?
Harry Potter: Don't try and cheer me up again, 'kay?

Harry Potter is turning over a new leaf – he will never meddle in things that aren't his business from now on. He's had it with sneaking around and spying.

Oliver Wood wrote on Gryffindor Quidditch Team'91-'92's wall: SHUT UP, SEEKER.

Ronald Weasley is somewhat glad this whole fiasco happened – now Hermione Jean Granger has stopped drawing attention to herself in class. She's actually bearable! Not only that, Harry Potter is now one of the most hated people in Hogwarts – that makes me more popular than him!

Ronald Weasley: Snape must've broken Quirrell! I'm surprised he even lasted a week. Props.
Hermione Jean Granger: There's still Fluffy, though. Honestly, how could you guys keep forgetting about that beast?
Ronald Weasley: Maybe Snape's found a way past Fluffy without Hagrid. I bet there's a book somewhere in here telling you how to get past a giant three-headed dog.
Hermione Jean Granger: RONALD! Are you finally believing in the power of BOOKS?
Ronald Weasley: NO FUCKING WAY. I'm just saying that it's probably a F.A.Q. when it comes to a creature like Fluffy.
Hermione Jean Granger: REGARDLESS – we have to go to Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves, we'll be thrown out fosho.
Harry Potter: But we have NO PROOF. Quirrell is such a pussy that he won't back us up. Snape's just going to deny any knowledge about the troll on Halloween...and they're going to believe a grown man over three little children who hate his guts. Filch really hates me out of association with Hedwig...and we're not even supposed to know about the Stone in the first place! The whole thing is just sketchy. We're not going and THAT'S FINAL.

Harry Potter: Are you for real? In case you've forgotten, WE'RE ELEVEN! I do not want to witness death! A grown man wouldn't want to do this!
Draco Malfoy: I don't care about that – I care about whether the thing that hurt the unicorn will find US. My physical wellbeing is much more important than my mental wellbeing – gotta look good, you know. Prince of Slytherin and all that.
Rubeus Hagrid: ...Totally ignoring everything past the sentence in which the unicorn was the focus of. There's nothing in the forest that'll hurt you if you're with Fang or me.

Harry Potter: Okay, this is getting ridiculous. What in your brain is making you believe that having Neville and Draco together, ALONE, is a good idea?
Rubeus Hagrid: Well, if Malfoy's with you or Hermione, you'd guys would probably either kill each other, or snog each other senseless, and I can't have that happening.
Harry Potter: Huh? Boys snogging? Each other? What a weird idea. Strangely appealing...

Harry Potter wrote on Rubeus Hagrid's wall: Could a werewolf be killing the unicorns?
Rubeus Hagrid: Did you NOT read my retort to Malfoy's previous statement about the existence of werewolves in the forest? It's impossible for a werewolf, which only really exists in beast form for 24 hours, to be able to make two separate attacks over the spread of a week and a half. But also, on the technical side, werewolves just aren't fast enough.
Harry Potter: A simple "no" would've sufficed.

Harry Potter THANK LORD. Now, can you explain to me what that was? The coward has deleted his Facebook.
Firenze You are the Potter boy.
Harry Potter Er...yes. That is my name. It's right there, to the left of my comments.
Firenze You better get back to Hagrid. The forest isn't safe, especially for you, dude. Get on my back – it'll be quicker.
 Harry Potter Giddy up, horsey!
 Firenze Ah... should've known this would happen.
Harry Potter and Firenze are now friends.

Harry Potter is finally living out his life-long dream of riding on a horse! ^_^ (sent from mobile)
Firenze: Seriously, I'm a centaur. Not cool.

Bane wrote on Firenze's wall: WHAT ARE YOU DOING? You're acting like a common MULE, letting a human ride you – have you no shame?
Firenze: Don't you realize who this is – this is the Potter boy. He has to leave the forest ASAP.
Harry Potter: Why must you refer to me as "the Potter boy?" there's only one Potter attending Hogwarts. Come to think of it, I believe I'm the only Potter in the UK.
Severus Snape: Oh my god, you DISGUST me. How could you think that you're the ONLY Potter in all of the United Kingdom? Are you THAT arrogant to believe you're so special?
Harry Potter: Snape  – Please - you're not involved in this.
Bane: What have you been telling him? Remember – we are sworn not to set ourselves against the heavens.
Ronan: I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting for the best.
Firenze: Not really, it was pretty impulsive.
Bane: For the best? What is that to do with us? We only care about what has been foretold. We're NOT supposed to run around like donkeys after stray humans in our forest!
Firenze: OMG you're so annoying – did you NOT see that very dead unicorn? Do you not know why it was killed? Or have the planets not let you in on that secret?
Harry Potter: Oooh, burn!
Firenze: I'm against what is creepin' in my hood – even if it means allying myself with humans.

Harry Potter wrote on Firenze's wall: I'm confuse. Why's Bane so angry? And can you PLEASE answer my question of what was that thing you saved me from?
Firenze: Harry Potter...do you know what unicorn blood is used for?
Harry Potter: Oh, I can't convey the number times I have to inform people on a daily basis that I have little to no knowledge of anything magical. I'm barely passing my classes as it is.
Firenze: Well, it's a monstrous thing to slay a unicorn.
Harry Potter: I think it's a monstrous thing to slay any sort of animal...
Firenze:Only one who has nothing to lose, and everything to gain, would commit such a crime.
Harry Potter: I feel Hagrid's pain. Communicating with your people actually feels like pulling teeth.
Firenze: The blood of unicorn will keep you alive, even if you're just about ready to croak, but as a price, your life would be a living hell, all cursed and whatnot.
Harry Potter: Now who would want that? Hm, I wonder if I drink it, if my life would stay the same. I mean I pretty much live a cursed life as it is...
Firenze:Nah. While you have some luck every once in a while to brighten your miserable existence, unicorn blood would take that away.
Harry Potter: I practically live for my convenient spouts of random luck. So who would be that desperate to live – wouldn't death just be easier?
Firenze: Yeah, it would, but some people just can't accept death. It's rather stupid, but c'est la vie. Unless it's only needed until you drink something better...Mr. Potter, do you know what's hidden in the school at this very moment?
Harry Potter: ...Um...can you give me a second? I know it, I really do, it's just...on the tip of my tongue. OH, DUH, THE SORCERER'S STONE! The Elixir of Life! But who –?
Firenze: Can you honestly not think of one person who is dying to get back to life? (the pun was intentional btw)
Harry Potter: Oh no, you mean Vol
Harry Potter wrote on Rubeus Hagrid's wall: Oh my god, HAGRID, stop stealing my phone! Kleptomaniac. But I'm really happy to see you. Even you, Hermione! P.S. The unicorn is dead.

Firenze wrote on Harry Potter's wall: This is where I leave you. You're safe now.
Harry Potter: Yeah...I figured I was already safe after you saved me...
Firenze: Good luck, Harry Potter. The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one of those times.
 Harry Potter: Well that's not ominous or anything...

 Ronald Weasley Mehhhhh.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: Snape wants the Stone for Voldemort, not for himself! And Voldy is hiding in the forest – just bumped into him, nbd.
Ronald Weasley: STOP WRITING OUT HIS NAME. Reading it is just as bad as hearing it!
Harry Potter: Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so...which is kind of stupid, but whatever. The centaurs think Voldemort's coming back and that he's going to kill me. Hah, they're a bunch of crocks – none of that should happen.
Ronald Weasley: STOP IT!
Harry Potter: So I guess I should just sit on my hands while Snape gets the Stone for Voldemort, and he'll just come back to life and kill me. Bane would probably be happy.
Bane: Yes, yes I would. The planets should not be tampered with!
Hermione Jean Granger: Okay, Harry, you'll come to know in time that I find all this "predicting the future" to be a lot of lies, and McGonagall would agree with me. And besides, with Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you, since he's scared to death of the man. I don't really blame him – Dumbledore is cracked.
Harry Potter: Thanks, Hermione. This is one of the rare moments where I appreciate you.

Chapter Text
Harry Potter could have SWORN on his mother's grave that Voldemort was bursting through the doors whilst taking his Transfiguration exam...it was just Ron coming in from a bathroom break. Close call.
Ronald Weasley:Are you kidding? AND STOP SAYING HIS NAME.
Harry Potter:You're being such a coward. And no, I'm not kidding...Voldemort can come out of anywhere at anytime! In broad daylight. In the middle of an exam. He's a master of SURPRISE!
Ronald Weasley:No...he's not actually. I'm sorry but even I'm not that dumb. He's not going to barge in while you're taking your History of Magic test! He'd be more likely to come during Potions. Him and Snape are tight.
Hermione Jean Granger:Ugh! You both are so STOOPID.
Ronald Weasley:GTFO, Hermione! Harry and I are having an intense meeting of minds.
Hermione Jean Granger:What we REALLY have to worry about is our exams! I'm SO nervous about Flitwick's practical – he's making us charm a pineapple to tapdance across the desk!
Harry Potter:That's simple for you, isn't it?
Hermione Jean Granger:Never can be too prepared.

Harry Potter OMG guys, Snape is being super creepy breathing down all our necks while we take our exams!
(Ronald Weasley and 149 others like this.)
Severus Snape: THAT'S IT! You're getting an incomplete on your exam.
Harry Potter:WHY?
Severus Snape:Because half of the test is based on your ability to deal with my hot breath on the nape of your neck.
Harry Potter:You're disgusting. I'm dealing with a lot already, SIR.
Severus Snape:Well aren't you special? Would you like to be exempt from all exams just because you have a little twinge in your itty-bitty scar? Cry me a river.
Harry Potter:How did you know about the pain in my scar!
Severus Snape Because you keep grabbing at it and murmuring, "my scar, oh my scar," in intervals of about five to ten minutes. Brat.

Neville Longbottom wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Exam nerves, Harry?
Harry Potter:No, Neville, I'm plagued by a dream of a hooded figure following me through the forest, dripping blood all over the dirt.
Neville Longbottom:O_O You didn't have to get so sarcastic (or graphic!). I was just asking.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: Maybe it's because you don't have a burning scar on your forehead, but I don't quite understand why you're not more worried about the Sorcerer's Stone!
Ronald Weasley:Harry, I expect that we'll be friends for a very, very long time. Perhaps for life. So I think it's about time you start realizing something...I...kind of don't give a shit. About anything.
Harry Potter:That's kind of depressing.
Ronald Weasley:Yeah well, that's what happens when you're stuck in a family of so many kids. My mum doesn't give a shit about learning my twin brother's names; nobody gives a shit if I eat or live or anything. So...I don't really give a shit about the Sorcerer's Stone. I'm just trying to get through this cursed life and maybe make a name for myself. But I'll probably just end up with a mediocre, low-paying job like my father and if I'm lucky, a wife and a couple of kids. I know that you have all of these wonderful ambitions of becoming this great hero and slayer of the Dark Lord but...it just sounds kind of exhausting to me.
Harry Potter:Wow, Ron, tell me how you really feel...Jesus Christ...

Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Wow! That History of Magic exam was a lot easier than I thought! I needn't have learned about the 1637 Werewolf Code of Conduct or the uprising of Elfric the Eager!
Ronald Weasley:Who the FUCK says the word "needn't"? You sound like such a jackass, Hermione.
Hermione Jean Granger: Please stay slient, sir. I enjoy going over my exam papers after my exams! And if you don't like it you can just skidaddle!
Ronald Weasley:Gladly. All this talk of exams makes me feel ill.
Harry Potter:Please, don't make Ron feel any worse than he already does! I feel like he's allowed me to peek into his mind a few minutes back in my last wall post and I'm a bit frightened to say that it's a very dark, bitter place!
Ronald Weasley:Eh.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Well, at least we have a week before we find out how badly we've done, I guess.
Harry Potter:Yeah...that is a plus ^_^
Hermione Jean Granger:You should begin studying for next year.
Ronald Weasley:Stfu!
Harry Potter:I WISH I KNEW WHAT THIS MEANS!
Hermione Jean Granger: What?
Ronald Weasley:Wtf?
Hermione Jean Granger:Ugh, we just had the same thought but for once, it makes sense...now really, Harry...you can't just burst out like that whilst ripping at your forehead...it's creepy.
Ronald Weasley:Yeah, as if we have that much going for our group to begin with...we've got bucktoothed bush-head over here drowning out all other sound with her bitch-ass motor-mouth, we've got me, a scrawny ginger who's only ambition is to be somewhat like his thousands of brothers or his BFF Harry, a freaky four-eyed bitch who keeps whining about a scar the darkest wizard of all time gave to him as a effing baby...oh yeah, and then there's Neville always hanging around us.
Neville Longbottom:Hey!
Ronald Weasley:You know it's true.
Neville Longbottom:Yeah...
 Harry Potter:I KNOW, but it HURTS! ARGGH!
Hermione Jean Granger:*sigh* Your scar?
Harry Potter:YES MY SCAR – I THOUGHT YOU WERE SUPPOSED TO BE A GENIUS. IT HAPPENS ALL THE FUCKING TIME AND I TELL YOU ABOUT IT WHAT DO YOU JUST DROWN ME OUT? CAN YOU HEAR ME THROUGH THAT BUSHY MESS YOU CALL HAIR?
Hermione Jean Granger:T_T
Ronald Weasley:Harry...that was really mean...
Harry Potter:This coming from the good for nothing loser who makes fun of Hermione just to make his own self feel better!
Hermione Jean Granger:GET OVER TO MADAM POMFREY THEN, LUNATIC!
Harry Potter:I'm not ill!
Ronald Weasley:Oh?
Harry Potter:I'm sorry, guys, I didn't mean to employ cap-locks so incessantly, I just...I just know that this means that danger is coming.
Ronald Weasley:Alright, well...I guess we'll just ignore how out of your mind fucking CRAZY that sounds...but what can ya do? Just relax, Harry. The Stone's safe, man. Neville will play Quidditch for England before Hagrid let's Dumbledore down.

Ronald Weasley:Well, please explain because my head is still filled with utterly useless information that Hermione forcibly shoved into my ear.
Hermione Jean Granger:You're welcome.
Harry Potter:Anyway...don't you think it's odd that what Hagrid wants more than anything in his whole sad little world is a dragon, and this creepy-ass stranger just HAPPENS to have an egg in his POCKET?
 Ronald Weasley:You lost me at "anyway..."

Harry Potter wrote on Rubeus Hagrid's wall: What did the stranger you were playing cards with look like? The one who gave you Norbert?
Rubeus Hagrid:Dunno.
Harry Potter: ARE YOU KINDDING ME RIGHT NOW? ARE YOU REALLY KIDDING ME, HAGRID? I DO NOT HAVE TIME TO DO THIS WHILST ATTEMPTING TO SAVE THE ENTIRE WIZARDING WORLD!
Rubeus Hagrid:Sheesh, Harry. He wouldn't take his cloak off.
Harry Potter, Ronald Weasley, and Hermione Jean Granger sent Rubeus Hagrid looks of astonishment.
Rubeus Hagrid wrote on Harry Potter's wall: It ain't that weird! Ya get a whole lot of funny folk in the Hog's Head. Might have been a dragon dealer...he kept his damn hood up, as I SAID.
Harry Potter:Ugh, Hagrid...did you talk about Hogwarts at all?
Rubeus Hagrid:Mighta come up. Yeah...uh...he asked about what I did...asking about the sorta creatures I look after...I said I wanted a dragon...uh...I can't really remember too well...
Harry Potter:What were you drunk or something?
Rubeus Hagrid:Well, obviously. He kept buying me drinks.
Harry Potter:O_O
Rubeus Hagrid:What? It was pretty nice of him, in my humble opinion! SO yeah, he said he had a dragon egg and we could play cards for it...but he had to be sure I could handle it, because he didn't want it to go to any old home...so I told him, after Fluffy, a dragon would be easy...
Harry Potter:...did he seem...*interested* in Fluffy?
Rubeus Hagrid:Um, obviously. How many three-headed dogs have you met? So I told him that you just have to play a little music to calm down the beast.
Harry Potter:Hagrid...I honestly feel like I'm speaking to a SEVERELY mentally challenged individual right now.
Rubeus Hagrid:Oh wait...I totez shouldn't have told you all that. HEY! WHERE ARE YOU RUNNING OFF TO? BUNCHA GOOD-FOR-NOTHING BRATS.

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: Clearly, we've got to go to Dumbledore. Hagrid told that stranger how to get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak. It was SO easy; he got Hagrid shwasted!
Hermione Jean Granger:Well, let's find Dumbledore's office...

Minerva McGonagall wrote on Harry Potter's wall: And what are you three doing inside?
Hermione Jean Granger:We need to speak to Professor Dumbledore.
Minerva McGonagall:Excuse me? What could you three possibly want to do with him? Haven't stayed out of trouble for long enough, have you?
Harry Potter:It's sort of...secret...
Ronald Weasley:Yes, Harry, bruise the ego of one of the bitchiest professors in Hogwarts...nice.
Harry Potter:Shut up! I panicked! I don't see you offering anything to this conversation!
Ronald Weasley:As I should! And you should keep your trap shut, too, mate.
Minerva McGonagall:Ahem. Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago. He received an urgent owl from the Ministry of Magic and flew off for London.
Harry Potter:He's...GONE? NOW?
Minerva McGonagall:In case you weren't aware, Potter, he's kind of a big deal.
Harry Potter:Right...but this is important.
Minerva McGonagall:More important than what the Ministry of Magic has to say? Jesus, Potter, you're doing a terrible job of convincing me that Snape is wrong about you insane narcissism.
Harry Potter: Listen, Professor...it's about, uh, the Sorcerer's Stone –
Minerva McGonagall:O_O I can see it's going to be a long seven years with you, Potter. I don't think I even want to know the answer to this, but...how do YOU know ANYTHING about that?
Harry Potter:Well...I know that Sn- I mean...that *someone*is going to try and steal the Stone. I've got to talk to Professor Dumbledore.
Minerva McGonagall sent Harry Potter a look of shock and suspicion.
Minerva McGonagall wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow. I don't know HOW you found out about the Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it.
Harry Potter:But-
Minerva McGonagall:Alright, let's cut it right here. I have tried to hold back and suspend disbelief with you, Potter, but enough is enough. Now don't you dare try to imply that I don't know what I'm talking about, because quite honestly, you have already insulted me beyond repair! I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy the sunshine!
Ronald Weasley:Never has the statement "enjoy the sunshine," sounded quite so threatening.

Harry Potter wrote on Ronald Weasley's wall: Kay, so clearly if I've got the guts to offend Professor McGonagall and truly not show symptoms "Giving a damn," I hope you and Hermione have assumed we're going through with the plans as follows: tonight Snape's going through the trapdoor. He finally knows everything, and Dumbledore's out of the way. We're gonna have to stop him.
Ronald Weasley:That's not much of a plan...I mean you've left out a lot of details. "We're gonna stop him" is hardly an active response...how about some bullet points?
Harry Potter:I'm getting to that! Geez...so anyway, let's talk more about how Snape is a dirty, rotten –
Severus Snape:Good afternoon.
Harry Potter:ARRGGHHHHHHHH!
Severus Snape:You shouldn't be inside...on a day like this...you should be out...enjoying the sunshine...
Severus Snape sent Harry Potter an odd, twisted smile.

Severus Snape: People are going to start to think you've actually put together enough brain cells in that empty little noggin of yours to actually produce a half-assed plan of action against those much more powerful than you.
Harry Potter:Okay, even if you AREN'T after the Stone, (which you totally and completely are, swear on my parents' grave, I'm never wrong), you're making it VERY difficult for anyone to believe you're innocent!
Severus Snape:Gryffindor can't afford to lose any more points, you twat. Be warned – any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally see that you are expelled. Have a nice day!

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: Right, so anyway, moving on...one of us has got to keep an eye on Snape – wait outside the staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, that's you.
Hermione Jean Granger:Why!
Ronald Weasley:Obviously you can pretend to be waiting for Professor Flitwick, you know... "Oh, Professor Flitwick! I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen bwrong!"
 Hermione Jean Granger:Suhfuhufgfyu shut up! I'll do it Harry, but only for you. And Ron, never make your voice that high again. It's unbecoming.
Ronald Weasley:Whatever you say, suck-up.
Harry Potter:And anyway, Ron and I will stay outside the third-floor corridor.

Harry Potter:Great. That's it then...isn't it?
Ronald Weasley:Are you gonna cry, mate?
Harry Potter:Maybe a little. But first, I'm gonna try and get to the Stone first!
Ronald Weasley:You're bloody mad!
Hermione Jean Granger:You CAN'T! You'll get expelled!
Harry Potter:SO WHAT? DON'T YOU UNDERSTAND? IF SNAPE GETS THE STONE, VOLDEMORT'S COMING BACK! I'VE ONLY KNOWN I WAS A WIZARD FOR MONTHS AND I SEEM TO KNOW MORE THAN EVERYONE! I MEAN, VOLDEMORT KILLED MY PARENTS...AS IF YOU NEED REMINDING! -_-
Hermione Jean Granger:You're...you're right Harry...
Harry Potter:Of course I am. I'll use the Invisibility Cloak...
Ronald Weasley:But will it cover all three of us?
Harry Potter:Uh...huh?
Ronald Weasley:Omg, enough with the hero act. Obviously you aren't going alone.
Hermione Jean Granger:How exactly do you think you'd get to the Stone without us? I'd better go look through my books...
Harry Potter:But then we'll all be expelled if we get caught.
Hermione Jean Granger:Not if I can help it! Flitwick told me I got a hundred and twelve percent on his exam! They're not throwing me out after that!
Ronald Weasley:Holy SHIT!
Ronald Weasley:This is the one time your unabashed intelligence can actually help us, though. Imagine if she got any lower than a hundred and twelve? She'd be jumping around Hogwarts just hoping someone would expel her and put her out of her misery.

Ronald Weasley:You are insufferable.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Everyone's clearing out, grab the Cloak.
Harry Potter:Got it. Now...I know that Hagrid said this insignificant birthday present was a spoon, but I think it'll double as a flute to put Fluffy to sleep.

Hermione Jean Granger: Obvi. But I don't have any wood, dumbass.
Ronald Weasley: ARE YOU A FUCKING WITCH OR NOT? Jesus Christ, we're lucky enough to have a genius with us, Harry, but we've got the stupidest one.
Hermione Jean Granger: Oh...right. Magic bluebell flames activate!
Ronald Weasley: About time. Way to not crack under pressure...there's no wood? Honestly...I'm too old for this shit.
Hermione Jean Granger: You're eleven.
Ronald Weasley: That's ten years too old for nonsense like this...though, I do rather enjoy "stupid Hermione." She's kind of down-to-earth.
Hermione Jean Granger: Oh shove it up your ass, Ron.
Ronald Weasley: Shove...what? Up my ass? Exactly?
Hermione Jean Granger: Your...stupid...comments...I guess...

Ronald Weasley became a fan of stupid Hermione.

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: Okay enough. Thank you for at least coming to your senses at some point and lighting a fire. At least we're okay. It's this way. "There's no wood" honestly.....
Hermione Jean Granger:I'm going to ignore half of that. But anyway, how do you know, Harry?
Harry Potter:Because it's the only way.
Hermione Jean Granger:I think we should use the GPS on my phone just in case.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Do you think they'll attack us if we cross the room?
Harry Potter: Probably. They don't look vicious...but you never know. It could be a wizarding remake of The Birds if they all attack at once. Except we'll actually see the damage done. Meaning pieces of my flesh will be eaten. Eyeballs hanging out of sockets...that sort of thing.
Hermione Jean Granger: Hah, an Alfred Hitchcock reference. Classic.
Ronald Weasely:Haha, you said cock.

Harry Potter: How should I know?
Ronald Weasley: Well YOU'RE the one with the big ideas, mister! I thought you had all this shit panned out!
Harry Potter: Ron, I'm eleven, I can't think that far in advance. My brain hasn't developed all that much from when I was one.
Hermione Jean Granger: Well these birds can't be here for just decoration!
Harry Potter: It seems stupid Hermione hasn't quite left the building.

Harry Potter just had a flash of brilliance! They're not birds, they're keys! (sent from mobile)
Ronald Weasley: Whoa, you're right! Wow, how could we completely mistake these obviously shaped flying keys for birds? We're certainly not the brightest tools in the shed.
Harry Potter: ...you mean SHARPEST tools in the shed. Or, if you wanted to go the other way, it would be brightest bulbs in the...box? What would you answer for that?
Hermione Jean Granger: Wow, we are so screwed. P.S. you're correct, Harry, it's "brightest bulb in the box."
Harry Potter: Ranking of Intelligence Tonight: 1. Harry Potter 2. Ron Weasely/Hermione Granger. You two have both been ridiculous tonight, so you're pretty much tied. But right now, Hermione is in the lead by a nose, thanks to Ron's comment about "bright tools."
Ronald Weasley: Hey, screw you! I'm not familiar with Muggle expressions! So I mix them up! Big-fucking-whoop. At least I try! Assholes.
Harry Potter:Okay, shut up, Ron, we don't care. Look – we have to catch the key to the door. See the broomsticks?
Hermione Jean Granger: Erm, I don't know if you recall, Harry, but my flying skills are non-existent. I will be of no use.
Harry Potter: Oh, I'm aware, believe me. Both you and Ron will be no use in this situation, especially since this is my area of expertise. Honestly, don't these fuckers know that since I've made my great return to this world, I'm basically going to get involved in every shady piece of business involving the greatest evil of epic proportions? They're making it a lot easier by tailoring the journey to ultimate victory to me.
Ronald Weasley: I'm beginning to agree with Snape, mate, you are a conceited prick. Oh, and since you need to know what you're looking for, you may want to know that the key we need is a big, old-fashioned one. Probably silver, like the handle.

Ronald Weasley: OMFG you CANNOT be more annoying right now. You're almost as bad as Granger, and that's saying something.
Harry Potter: Take that back!
Hermione Jean Granger: Ron's right, Harry, and I never say this. It seems that by becoming more intelligent...your annoyance factor exponentially increases.

Harry Potter: Oh no...now I'm beginning to understand: each blockway is somehow matching of our skills. So this must mean that it's Ron's turn to act cocky.
Ronald Weasley: We have to be chessmen. We're going to be the black pieces, because we're badass motherfuckers. Mostly me.

Ronald Weasley wrote on Harry Potter's wall: I'm going to be blunt: you and Hermione suck balls.
Harry Potter: You mean at chess, right?
Ronald Weasley: Right. And at life, too, but at the moment, chess is the only thing that matters.
Harry Potter: Ugh, I can't believe I was this much of an asshole fifteen minutes ago...okay, Ron, what do you want us to do.
Ronald Weasley: Harry – you're the bishop. Hermione – you're the castle.

Ronald Weasley: I'm going to be a knight.

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: What do you reckon's next?
Hermione Jean Granger: Well, let's see...Devil's Snare was Sprout's...Flitwick's had to be the charmed keys...McGonagall's was the chess game...so that leaves Quirrell's and Snape's.
Harry Potter: Wait...wouldn't it make more sense for McGonagall to have transfigured the keys into half bird/half key, and Flitwick to have charmed the chess pieces into moving?
Hermione Jean Granger: Honestly, yes, I thought the same thing, but let's be frank: Minerva McGonagall is fierce, and she WOULD have her defense be ruthless and deadly and have it involve actual use of the brain.
Harry Potter: Huh, true...

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: Thank god we didn't have to fight that troll – it's even bigger and more repulsive than the first one.

Harry Potter wrote on Hermione Jean Granger's wall: What did we just read? It felt like a Dr. Suess poem. (why are we making so many Dr. Seuss references?)
Hermione Jean Granger: It's not magic, it's a use of logic to solve a puzzle. You know, many of the greatest wizards haven't got an ounce of logic. They'd be stuck here forever.
Harry Potter: okkkkayyy...but so will we, won't we?
Hermione Jean Granger: Are you serious, Potter? I'm one of the select few who are both great AND logical. Of course we're getting through. Just give me ten seconds to figure it out.

Hermione Jean Granger:The smallest bottle will get us through the black fire, toward the Stone.
Harry Potter: There's only enough for one of us. Well, it looks like I'll be going alone. No surprise there. Which one will take you through the purple? Because you're going to be drinking that.
Hermione Jean Granger: Okay, looks like my usefulness has run its course.
Harry Potter: You got that right. You drink that, and get back and get Ron. Grab brooms from the flying-key room...that should help you get past Fluffy...and just go to the owlery and get Hedwig to contact Dumbledore. I might be able to hold Snape off for a while, but I'm no match for him, really.
Hermione Jean Granger: Understatement of the century.
Harry Potter: Thanks for the vote of confidence.
Hermione Jean Granger: Well, I mean, what if You-Know-Who's with him?
Harry Potter: Well, I was lucky once, wasn't I? Hence the scar. I may get lucky again.

Hermione Jean Granger: You're a great wizard, you know.
Harry Potter: Oh, wow, er...thanks? I suppose. I'm honestly not as good as you. I can barely remember half the spells we learned this year.
Hermione Jean Granger: I'm only going to say this once: really, there are so many more important things than books and cleverness.
Harry Potter:*GASP!*
Hermione Jean Granger: Hear me out: things like friendship and bravery are much more important.
Harry Potter: Well that's a rather cheesy answer...
Hermione Jean Granger: Shushhh! I'm being sentimental! Now be careful!
Harry Potter: You drink first. I kind of don't trust you for finding the right potions so quickly.
Hermione Jean Granger: Coward.

Chapter Text
Harry Potter sent Quirinus Quirrell an accusatory finger point.Harry Potter wrote on Quirinus Quirrell's wall: YOU!Quirinus Quirrell:That's right, me. I've been wondering when you'd come around.Harry Potter: Hey! You fixed your stutter!Harry Potter: Okay, I've actually read your comment (I was distracted by the lack of stuttering the first go around), and you've got to be kidding me! You were literally at the bottom of my list of suspects. EVEN Binns was ahead of you, for cripe's sake! I thought it was Snape for sure!Quirinus Quirrell:HA. Yes, he does seem like the cretin. But he was actually stalking me. If you read his list of interests, "stalking Quirrell," "following Quirrell," and other such activities are listed.Harry Potter: But that was under my interests, too! I thought it was just a joke! I didn't think you were actually suspicious! I mean Snape tried to kill me!Quirinus Quirrell:Nah, that was all me, baby. It totally would've worked, too, if only your know-it-all friend, Granger, didn't knock me over and break my eye contact! And Snape, of course, was muttering that countercurse...so I actually didn't really stand a chance...but I DEFINITELY COULD'VE KILLED YOU THEN.Harry Potter:o_O Snape was trying to SAVE me? Pull the other one!Quirinus Quirrell:I don't joke. Why else would he want to ref your next match? It definitely wasn't to fulfull a lifelong dream of being a Quidditch referee! But whatevs, it's all for nothing, since I'm going to kill you anyway. Right now.
Quirinus Quirrell sent Harry Potter binding ropes.Quirinus Quirrell wrote on Harry Potter's wall: You're too nosy to live, Potter. It's disgusting – it's almost in the same league of annoyance as Granger's intellect. On Halloween, I almost killed you for your insolence...scurrying around the school like that.Harry Potter: You let the troll in?Quirinus Quirrell:No SHIT. I have a special gift with trolls.Harry Potter: That's not something to be boastful about...Quirinus Quirrell;SHUT UP, YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN. You saw what I did to the one back there! But Snape, who was already suspicious of me, tried to head me off on Halloween. That day was such a fail – not only did the troll fail to kill you, Fluffy didn't even tear off Snape's leg properly. Now, I just need you to stfu so I can examine this mirror...

But, please, continue talking...Quirinus Quirrell:So yeah, they hated each other. But Snape never wanted you dead, geez.Harry Potter: But I heard you crying like a baby a few days ago...Quirinus Quirrell:Er...yes...sometimes I find it hard to follow my master's instructions. After all...he's so powerful and awesome and wonderful.Harry Potter: HOLD THE PHONE. You mean to tell me that Voldemort was there in the classroom with you?Quirinus Quirrell: He's with me wherever I go.Harry Potter: That's not creepy or anything...(HINT THE SARCASM).Quirinus Quirrell: Yes, it was a lovely spring day during my travels around the world. I was a n00b at the time, and he found me, telling me that there is no good and evil...there's only power, and those too weak to seek it.Harry Potter: That's such a load of lies. You honestly, actually believed that?Quirinus Quirrell: Check my religion on my profile. ANYWAY, before you rudely interrupted with your yelling of: WAIT, STOP TYPING, I MUST RESPOND TO WHAT YOU JUST SAID, I was talking about my faithful devotion to Lord Voldemort, who has punished me manyatime for my failures...especially my epic fail at Gringotts, for not taking the Stone then...Harry Potter: Oh my god, I was shaking your hand that day!

Quirinus Quirrell wrote on Harry Potter's wall: Look in the mirror and tell me what you see!Harry Potter: Stop being so demanding! You could say "please" every once in a while – it's a magical word and it will get you far in life.Dudley Dursley: Oh, VOMIT, Potter. You can't be spouting that and not get kicked out of you. And you have friends? Well, not that the ginger and that know-it-all snot are very good friends...Harry Potter: Dudley, I'm kind of in the middle of something important. It has to do with preventing an evil man from regaining his powers, and your comments are seriously irrelevant, not to mention NOT WELCOME.Dudley Dursley:You know what, be grateful that I'm even in your life.Harry Potter: Are you serious? Did you really just type that? AGH you're distracting me! Go away!Quirinus Quirrell: SHUT UP AND DO AS I SAY!Dudley Dursley: Wow, someone really hates you, Pot-head.

Look, I don't know why random people like you or Dudley are trying to talk to me right now, but it has to stop.Hermione Jean Granger: I'm hardly random!

I'm going to have a dialogue with a turban? I'm sorry, I really try to avoid talking to inanimate objects, even those that talk back, so let's just not do this...
Harry Potter OMG, it feels like Devil's Snare is rooting me to the spot. This is rather annoying. I would really like to get out of here...but Quirrell is unwrapping his turban, and, frankly, I'm quite interested in what color his hair is.

See what I have become? Mere shadow and vapor. It's crazy. I have to share a body, which is really as annoying as it sounds, especially since they have to be open to me, like dear Quirrell, who has been drinking Unicorn blood for me, making me stronger. But once I have the Elixir of Life, I will be able to create a body of my own.Harry Potter: Um, yeah, that's not going to happen, since you don't have the Stone, and Quirrell is too stupid to figure out how the mirror works to get the Stone...so HA HA.Lord Voldemort's Face: We don't need the mirror anymore, since you have the Stone in your pocket already! So convenient. Why don't you give me it right now?

I killed your father first, and he put up a courageous fight...but your mother needn't have died...Harry Potter: Oh my god, you actually use the word "needn't" too? Holy moly on a cracker, that's wickity wack! Hermione's not the only one, then.Lord Voldemort's Face: STOP INTERRUPTING ME WHILE I'M TALKING ABOUT THE MURDER OF YOUR PARENTS. K thanks.

Madam Pomfrey felt it was unhygienic, but I got a right laugh out of the whole situation.Harry Potter:Pomfrey's such a humorless lady.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:A *fierce* humorless lady. She gets the job done with style.Harry Potter:So, how long have I been here?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Just three days.Harry Potter:SAY WHAAAA?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Anywho, Ronald and Hermione will be happy to see you've come round. They were worried. I wasn't, because you've already survived an attack from Lord Voldemort before, and now you're older and stronger. I mean, logic would say you'd be fine once again...Harry Potter:Right, but the Stone...Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Oh, right. I forgot you kind of devoted the entire year to that. Right, so, where was I?Harry Potter:Nowhere. You have told me nothing in the entire time I've been awake. You've just sat there.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Ah, right. So...Quirrell didn't manage to take it from you. I arrived in time to prevent that, of course.Harry Potter:Oh, so I face down the most intense tasks I've ever seen in my entire life (and remember, I faced down the Dark Lord at age one), discovered the stuttering mess of a professor is actually harboring Voldemort as some sort of messed up parasite on the back of his head, and endured disgusting, seemingly endless pain until I passed out for the last three days, yet you saunter onto the scene and get all the glory?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Pretty much. But you were doing pretty well on your own, I guess...Harry Potter:How did you get there anyway? Hermione's owl?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Well, no, that was all me as well. By the time I reached London it became clear to me that the place I should be was the one I had just left. I arrived just in time to pull Quirrell off of you.Harry Potter:You're definitely giving yourself too much credit. After all, who's idea was it to leave Hogwarts in THE FIRST PLACE? Aren't you supposed to be the greatest wizard ever? Like, WHAT? You made it all the way to London before you realized you shouldn't have left Hogwarts?  I could've told you that two-steps outside of this place and I'm only eleven!Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:That's ENOUGH. We all make mistakes...even smarty-pants like me.Harry Potter:That's true, Hermione made a few miserable mistakes three nights ago.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Exactly. Thank you. So long story short, the Stone's been destroyed.Harry Potter:But-but...you're friend? Nicolas Flamel-Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Oh, you know about Nicolas?Harry Potter:How could THAT surprise you? Of all this nonsense, you'd think something else would throw you for a loop, but that was the straw that broke the aged headmaster's back.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:I guess you're right. Well Nicky and I said that it was for the best.Harry Potter:But he and his wife will die, won't they?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore: They have enough Elixir stored to set their affairs in order and then, yes, they will die. Obvi.Harry Potter:O_OAlbus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:lol, to someone as infantile as you, it seems incredible, but to the well-organized mind, death is but the next great adventure. Hmm...hmmm...hmmmmm...Harry Potter:Ignoring the fact that you just began humming at the end of that explanation...also ignoring the fact that you basically just told me I have a...cluttered mind? Because I don't really see death as an adventure, but whatever you want to think, old man. Anyway, even with the Stone gone, Vol-...I mean, You-Know-Who...Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Always use the proper name for things, Harry. Fear of a name increases fear of the thing itself.Harry Potter:Well you're just chock-full of interesting sayings and proverbs, aren't you? So Voldemort's going to try other ways of coming back, isn't he?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Yes, yes. He's still out there...he's not truly alive, so he can't be killed. He left Quirrell to die. Nevertheless Harry, while you may only have delayed his return to power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared to fight what seems a losing battle next time – and if he delayed again, and again, why, he may never return to power!Harry Potter:Um, are those "agains" going to involve me? Again and again? And again? Ugh.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Probably. It sure as heck isn't going to be me. I'm getting too old for this.Harry Potter:Well then, do something you're not too old for – sit on your butt and tell me the truth.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:The truth. It is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have a very good reason not to. I shall not, of course, lie.Harry Potter:Right. A simple "alright" wouldn't suffice, but I'm getting very used to your unnecessary pretenses. So...Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried to stop him from killing me. But why would he want to kill me in the first place?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Sigh. The first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today at least. Not now. One day...but put it from your mind until you're older.Harry Potter:And to think I was beginning to like you a little bit. Not only is "until you're older" the most stupid lie unit of time EVER, I have the greatest feeling that this will be one of your most immense regrets in a few years time.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Right you are, Harry. So very right you are.Harry Potter:I'm glad we're agreeing that this is the biggest mistake ever and moving on. So why couldn't Quirrell touch me?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:You're mother died to save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love as powerful as your mother's for you leaves its own mark. Not a scar, but it gives us an invisible sort of protection forever. Quirrell was full of hatred, greed, and ambition, so he couldn't touch you, being filled with so much love.Harry Potter:So you're seriously telling me that love is the answer to everything?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Well, not the answer to *everything*. Like...if someone asked me what I wanted for lunch, the answer is a Big Mac, not love.Harry Potter:It's still sappy.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Yes, well, what can one do. By the way, that last remark wasn't just an example, I'm famished. Let's try to wrap this up. Also, I'm going to stare out the window for a bit while you dry the tears from your eyes. It's making me a bit uncomfortable because I don't think you realized you were crying.Harry Potter:...alright, I'm good. And the Invisibility Cloak – do you know who sent it to me?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:This guy! Your father left it in my possession and I thought you'd like it. Whatevs. Nbd.Harry Potter:And there's something else...Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Don't you have anything to say to me?Harry Potter:Nope. Anyway, Quirrell says Snape hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy, actually! And then, your father did something he could *never*forgive: he saved his life :PHarry Potter:Snape *would* get angry about something like that. Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Professor Snape couldn't bear being in your father's debt. He worked so hard to preotect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back to hating him in peace...Harry Potter:That's messed up! Sheesh...oh, one more thing. How did I get that Stone out of the Mirror?Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:Oh, I'm so glad you asked that. I don't like to give myself compliments willy-nilly but this was BRILLIANT. It was one of my best ideas, and that's saying something. If you didn't get it already, I'm awesome. Anywho...only one who wanted to *find* the Stone – find it, but not use it – would be able to get it. Otherwise they'd just se themselves making gold or drinking Elixir of life. My brain surprises even me sometimes...Harry Potter:I feel like this is a joke that you just said that last statement. You're out of control but I appreciate the honesty.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore:^_^
Hermione Jean Granger wrote on Harry Potter's wall: HARRY!Harry Potter:You look like you're about to hug me and for more reasons than one, I have to suggest you don't.Hermione Jean Granger:Done and done. Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to...Harry Potter:Die? Please. I'm the Boy Who Lived.Ronald Weasley:The whole school's talking about it. What really happened in there!Harry Potter:Quirrell, the Mirror, the Stone, and Voldemort. Blah blah blah. Etc.Ronald Weasley: Ah, all right. So the Stone's gone? Flamel's just going to die?Harry Potter:Yeah...Dumbledore thinks that...uh..."to the well-organized mind, death is but the net great adventure," whatever that shit means.Ronald Weasley:Ha. Well, he's off his rocker. Sad, really.Harry Potter:So what happened to the two of you? Made out in a broom closet yet?Hermione Jean Granger:Enough. I brought Ron round – THAT took a while...Ronald Weasley:Jesus Christ, of course you'd think to blame me for being unconscious.Hermione Jean Granger:So we went to contact Dumbledore but met him in the Entrance Hall. He already knew. He just said, "Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?" and ran for the third floor. Pretty fast for an old man.Ronald Weasley:I think he devised the whole plan. Wanted you to do his dirty work, Harry. Sending you the Cloak and everything...Hermione Jean Granger:That's terrible! Harry couldn't died!Harry Potter:It's not terrible. I think he sort of wanted to give me the chance. Yes, he's off his rocker, and he's pretty conceited actually, but I reckon he had a pretty good idea what we were trying to do...it wasn't an accident that he let me find out how the Mirror worked.Ronald Weasley:That's fucked up. Is this for real? I mean, he can't have that much faith in an eleven-year-old. You're giving the old shit too much credit.Harry Potter:Eh, maybe.Ronald Weasley:Oh, by the way, I know you're tired from battling the darkest wizard of all time, but I thought I'd just rub it in your face one last time that at the end-of-year feast tomorrow, we're going to be destroyed by Slytherin in the points race.Harry Potter:...

Harry Potter wrote on Poppy Pomfrey's wall: Can I go to the feast? Can I? Can I? I want to be there when the Slytherin's defeat us it sounds like a blast!Poppy Pomfrey:Professor Dumbledore says you're allowed to go. Ask me? I think he's full of it.Harry Potter:Yeah, he is. But yay! I'm putting my health at risk to face defeat head on! I'm such a brave little boy.Poppy Pomfrey:Oh, enough. Snape was so right about you...anyway, you have a visitor.
Rubeus Hagrid wrote on Harry Potter's wall: WAAAHHHHHH it's all my fault!Harry Potter:?Rubeus Hagrid:I told the evil git how to get past Fluffy! I told him! You could've died! All for a dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I'm such an alcoholic!Harry Potter:Yeah.Rubeus Hagrid:This is where you come in and say, oh no, it's okay Hagrid. We're still buddies...Harry Potter:Oh, we're still buddies. And it is okay. But I mean I'm not going to deny the fact that you totally messed up everyone's day because you're a drunk. Seriously, you should probably seek counseling. I'm just saying that as a friend.Rubeus Hagrid:I guess you're right...Harry Potter:I am. Here, have a Chocolate Frog, cheer up big guy.Rubeus Hagrid:Oh, I gotcha a present.Harry Potter:I'm sure whatever this is, it will in no way make up for the near loss of my life...Rubeus Hagrid:It's a picture book...all pictures of your parents from old school friends. Ya know.Harry Potter:Oh my god. I seriously did not expect this. Like you think I'd make a joke about how lame this is, but it's not. Wow...seriously, Hagrid, I even cried in front of Dumbledore about my parents. This actually does make up for everything.Rubeus Hagrid: ^_^Harry Potter:Seriously though, you definitely require AA.

Slytherin.Severus Snape wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Don't pick favorites or anything, Dumbledore.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Yeah, yeah, well done Slytherin. Small problem, recent events need to be taken into account.Severus Snape wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: ....Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Ahem. First, fifty points to Mr. Ronald Weasley for the best-played game of chess Hogwarts has seen in many years.Ronald Weasley wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Seriously? Only fifty points? I was knocked unconscious by a giant Queen!Draco Malfoy wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Ha-ha, I didn't know Hagrid was playing with you dumbasses.Rubeus Hagrid wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Hardy har, I'm a giant Queen...and you whine like a little baby girl, Malfoy.Draco Malfoy wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: WHAT! HOW IS THIS OAF NOT FIRED YET!Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: QUIET! Second, fifty points to Miss Hermione Granger, for the use of cool logic in the face of fire. And third to Mr. Harry Potter...for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.Ronald Weasley wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Srsly? You're shitting me. Harry only get's ten more points than ME? I mean I thought fifty was pretty lame, but I played fucking chess and Harry defeated the Dark Lord for a second time. Ten extra points! This school is fucked up.Harry Potter wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Alright Ron, I totally appreciate that rant, but if your math skills were any good, you would've realized that those points made us even with Slytherin.Ronald Weasley wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: Well he couldn't give you one more measly point? Shit.Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s: I beg Mr. Weasley to hold his incessant complaints for my last award. It takes a great deal of bravery to stand up to our enemies, but just as much to stand up to our friends. Ten points to Mr. Neville Longbottom.Neville Longbottom wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: FINALLY! SOME RECOGNITION!Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore wrote on We go to Hogwarts!'s wall: So I believe that we need a change of scenery...let's get rid of these Slytherin banners, eh?

You're still skinny-ass four eyes and you're cruising for a bruising.Harry Potter:You look fat today.Dudley Dursley:SHUT YOUR MOUTH! I'M ON A DIET. THIS IS WHY I HATE YOU, POTTER.
