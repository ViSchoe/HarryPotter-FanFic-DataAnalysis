Chapter Text
It was just another morning in Hogwarts. Snape was in his dungeon doing work and preparing for his classes. He knew that he need to go to Hogsmead and London to make different stops and more before the school year approached. He wasn't ready for the new dunderheads and knew that it was going to be a long year. One again he was taking with 1st 2nd and 7th years before he was going to get the 3rd 4ths and 6th years. He got himself ready and left to pick up what he needs to get and then headed back. He knew that once he got back that everyone would be needing him. Severus left and headed to Hogsmead where he picked up some stuff for potions and things he had ordered before and then headed over to London where he decided to get the rest and then who knows what was going to happen. What Snape didn't know was he was going to run into a beautiful girl that was going to change both of their lives.
