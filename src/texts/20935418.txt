Notes:
2019-10-08It's so much fun giving my voice to the HP kids again! It's been a bit tough to find the right voice for everyone in the beginning, especially after just finising HPATLOLS in which for example Draco is such a different character, and they are all older anyway... but I think I start to find my balance :) Chapter 3-5 are already mostly recorded and just need to be edited, so I hope I'll manage to upload more in the near future!(posted 19-10-09)

2019-10-10me @ myself why is it that in most fics the date is for the day you posted a chapter, but here it's for when you first saved it as a draft?me @ myself I have no frigging clue.Posted 19-10-20Anywayz, now I gotta go back to recording bc with this one I have edited everything I had recorded so far! Wish me luck, I hope I'll manage to keep the characters' voices similar to how I did them when I recorded the first chapters uuuu a month ago lol

yall know I'm at that weird level of english where I still make prononciation mistakes but when I listen to sb (or my own recording) talk I catch those mistakes? And it is So Frustrating bc I don't want to go and record each sentence again when I notice a mistake TM (if you don't have experience in recording/editing: no sadly I can't just record the single word, thatd sound even worse cause the tone of voice would be different and it would sound out of place in the sentence it's in, I tried that A Lot when I first started doing/actually editing podfic), send it to my laptop, download it, add it in, adjust the volume,... ughhh I just don't wanna, so I mostly leave it unless it's a mistake I'm particularily embarrassed about, so like... ughAnyways I think I mispronounced the word sarcasm several times in this, I'm sorry xD(other mistakes too, that is just the last one I noticed as I am writing this lol)Pls let me know when you listen to these & are enjoying them, that would literally make my day!!!

Btw, if you notice any mistakes in the recordings- especially when something is first said wrong and then corrected- do let me know, I only listen to each recording once while editing it and don't always catch every mistake :s

2019-11-02I actually managed to record and edit this despite exam stress, I'm proud of myself! XDMight not upload something next week, tho Also, how tf does this fic have a perfect 1:1 comment and kudos ratio? Lol (both 24 as I write this... Podfics never get as much attention as even the smallest ffs I write... Why do I put so much effort into sth barely anyone cares about... Eeeeh do I care bout that tho? No)

2019-11-06I think I mostly figured out everyone's voices by now! Might go over the first chapters at some point and edit/rerecord them to match, but I hope for now it's ok :)Posted 2019-11-07

Notes:
2019-11-07Posted 11-13Nooooo Sony Audio Recorder doesn't function properly anymore & it doesn't get updates anymore either I'm fuuuuckedDoesn't anyone know any apps I could use alternatively? Should- Be for Android/sony- Be for free (or like I'd pay 2€ if it's rly good but not more)- Decent quality- keep recording when the app is closed (I often read from the same phone I'm recording from)- Let me extract files by sending them via telegram messenger & then download them to my pc from there- files need to be audacity compatiblePlease help me out, otherwise I won't be able to record for the next months until I'm home where I have a mic that I can attach to my laptop, & even then I'd probably still record less than I do with my phone...

Guys honestly I still need a new recording app! I had already recorded this with the old one & only edited it now, but I can't record anything new until I have a new & functioning app!!! The old one keeps crashing :(I tried 'easy voice recorder' but the quali seems meh, it's only mono & not stereo & I can't rename files in the app (ofc I can do that once I have it in audacity, but I don't bloody well feel like having to guess which file I'm on all the time when editing)... So let's make some new requirements in addition to what I said last chapter:-Record in stereo-Good!!! Quality!!!-lets you rename files-has a pause button (& shooould have pause & resume buttons on screen or just to swipe while not in the app)Anyone know anything??

Notes:
19-11-27I love my Peeves voice tbh19-11-30Soo editing this atm- I usually pride myself with being as consistend as possible with the characters' voices, but honestly I kinda wanna stop editing Voldemort's voice rn... I already recorded him differently (phone further away from my face while speaking louder + of course making a specific voldy voice) than the other characters, and the paulstretch audacity edit I changed the first few sentences with just sounds sooo over the top at the 'let me speak to him' part, so idk... I think I'll just edit that /less/ and then once the turban is off it would kinda make sense for the voice to be diferent anyways so from then on it'll be unedited eeeeh maybe I'll go back to this in the future but for now I just want this chapter to be done already lolposted 19-12-02it's still at a 1:1 kudos:comment rate lol (36)
