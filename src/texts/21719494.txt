Chapter Text
This is based on a recipe that was supposed to taste just like the Wizarding World Orlando pumpkin juice. I haven't actually had the stuff, but judging by the stomach-churning sourness of the recipe I was given, that ain't it. This recipe is a HEAVILY edited version. More versions upcoming as I figure out what tastes best. First things first, you need pure pumpkin juice. Not tasty on it's own, but:
Take 1 can of puree'd pumpkin and plop it into a saucepan.
Add 1 can of water, 1 cinnamon stick, a hefty dash of allspice and a sprinkling of cloves.
Bring the lot to a rolling boil, allowing to boil for 3 minutes.
Remove from heat and cool completely.
Strain through several layers of cheesecloth, and bottle for later use.
 Cinnamon Syrup
2 cups sugar
1 cup water
2 cinnamon sticks
Boil all three together until the syrup goes clear (you're looking for the foamy white bubbles to stop). Theme Park Pumpkin Juice:
4 oz pure pumpkin juice
1 oz apricot nectar (check the hispanic section of your local grocery store, or get apricot juice from Trader Joe's)
1 oz cinnamon syrup
4 pinches citric acid (amazon is your best bet, but you can also get it in places that sell canning supplies- it's Ball Brand, and is clearly labeled "citric acid")
Dash vanilla extract
Shake all ingredients together in a cocktail shaker with ice. Strain into a glass.
