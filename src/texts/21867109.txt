              ~ Under the mistletoe ~ I saw her one day, part of some Christmas dream.She ignited everything, my passing whim.What was once cold, she lit up on firethe pores of my skin, chocked on desire.I want to take her to Diagon alley,buy her everything and a single red rose,to use as a bookmark on her favourite prose.I want to take her at my perfect quidditch lawnHear her moan - oh, hear her moan.But more than anything, just hear her want.So much longing and so much thought,an unforgiving, boundless, wretched, deep sea.Dripping out of me,dripping out of me.Dripping.Out.Of.Me.Like her eyes and her smile, always shining breaking free.Unless they are - well, unless they are directed at me.Thought she was the reason, to fight and to bebut she belongs to another, I want her alone and free!Down by the lake I cursed the ginger, the bluecolours that never suit her, but part of her true.I approached in terror and exquisite delightI caged her, held her - tight tight tight!Shouting at my demons, begging to let her gothough kissing her hard, under the mistletoe. I saw her again, that time I was awakeshe was ethereal and beautiful, my heart began to quake.And there I stood breathless, no reason at hand.To love or to hate her, my organs a band.Playing only for her.Only for her.For her.Her;and her hand.Heavy with a green ring, in a posh green land.A nuptial bed, a child, a treasurewith wit and brains beyond possible measure.Little moments passing like some fairy lights,and pudding and tea and Hogsmead delights.But gone is the honey, gone is the tea.One thing is left and that thing is just me.Opening my eyes, nothing seems realI’m half an inch closer to making a deal;to sacrifice everything for even a glancefill my body with ink, for a chance at romance.Alone I stood again, at Hogwarts Yule ball.Alone and bereft, ready to fall.Wishing her in my pocket, a new personal lowunder the mistle- under the mistletoe. I saw her next year and the one after that.And I swear she ignores me, for tit and for tat!Still I smile, kiss hands and try to forgetthat the world only sees my Death Eater debt.While she exhumes contentment and some hidden glee,a huge protruding belly beside the Christmas treesurrounded and happy by her brave hero clan,I am crumpling the head of my gingerbread man.While he touches her, kisses her, curling her toeI am aching and breaking, under the mistletoe. I saw her one day, but it was the millionth time sure.She was alone and lonely, too prone and too pure.The snake transformed to a lion, so strong is this love!Approached the wounded, exceptional dove,wanted to show her everything, apart from the crime.To explain and forgive her, at last to be mine.With knife and with strife and with a shout from a crow,I’m slicing red, under the mistletoe...                                ~o0o~
