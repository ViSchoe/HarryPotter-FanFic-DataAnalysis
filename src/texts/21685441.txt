Work Text:
The binding technique of this book is called 'case binding'. The outside is made from bookcloth (red for Harry and green for Snape), with the frays on the selvedge of the cloth intertwining on the spine. Normally you cut the selvedge off, but in this case I decided to make use of it. The titles were stamped on with the hot-foil stamping technique. I used red foil on Snape's side and green on Harry's side.
