There are a lot of things Neville does not understand about his new home. Why he has to be here is not one of them. His parents were in the Order and ended up targets and his Gran is determined their House will stand against Voldemort once more. That means they need protection. Fine. Neville understands why everyone else is there and has gotten over the Sirius Black debacle. The creature he just saw is not one of those things. He is vaguely aware of Ginny Weasley hovering over him with a cup of tea. Hardly helpful with a Hippogriff.
