Harry Potter had spent a year gallivanting around three continents. 
He’d hexed Dark Wizards in North America, MACUSA by his side. 
He’d swam in the warm white surf off the coast of Australia, Ron, Hermione and he finally free of the weight they’d carried since they were children. 
He’d eaten in the finest restaurants and been the guest of honour for a dozen nations. 
But nothing had satisfied Harry. Nothing satisfied Harry without Draco beside him, in his arms and in his bed. 
“I ran away,” Harry whispered to his beloved. “When everything I wanted… needed was here all along.”
