„Tu me rends heureuse.“Barely a whisper, Draco softly murmured when he pressed his forehead against his lover’s one. His both hands were steadily on Harry’s hips, pulling him unconsiously closer and closer just to make sure the man who had stolen his heart years ago won’t somehow slip away. Not that Harry would have a choice in that matter if he wanted to leave.They were not young boys anymore. They were far away from that but deep down both of them were the same. It did not matter how much time passed by since. And Draco couldn’t imagine not being here, spending his youth with someone else but Harry.There wasn’t someone else. Never was and never could be. Not in this lifetime and not in another ones because there was one thing Draco was more than sure of.They belonged together.Draco’s eyes fell shut when he felt Harry’s fingers tenderly caressing his pale cheeks, flushed with delicate shade of pink. Not even years of being together could vanish the feelings Draco cherished for his lover and every touch, look, word could set his whole body on fire.And he loved it with every inch of his soul.„Je sais, chéri.“ Harry whispered back, his own hands tighting around Draco’s neck as he scooted closer and placed a gentle kiss on his lips. A reassurance. A promise.„Tu es l’amour de ma vie.“
