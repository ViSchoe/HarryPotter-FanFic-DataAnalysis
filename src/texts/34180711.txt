Chapter Text
Draco looked around the Slytherin table and saw a couple of fifth years sitting where he used to sit, the centre of attention. Now he sat at the end of the table, alone. All his friends, who were Death Eaters-to-be or not, had decided to continue their lives.'But not me, all I learnt last year was how to be an asshole', Draco thought. He wanted a fresh start without all the drama from last year. But of course, his reputation was well known, and nobody dared to speak to him. Old Draco Malfoy would have loved this, feared by all. But he'd learnt there was no use in being feared, especially if you are hated.He looked across to the Gryffindor table to see Harry Potter, Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger.Harry Potter, now he was a boy who seemed full of life, surrounded by love and respect. Draco couldn't help be envious of him, as he'd always done."Malfoy!" Draco was snapped out of his daydream by a voice belonging to the raven-haired boy Draco had been thinking about, who was waving him over.'Oh boy, this is gonna be fun,' Draco walked over, dreading the worst. Harry stood up cautiously and held out his hand. "Let's start over; no fights, no insults. Just friends,". Draco's jaw dropped, as well as Ron's. Hermione, however, looked smug."Bloody hell, mate! Malfoy? Are you serious?!" Ron exclaimed."I-I um, what game are you playing at Potter?" Draco spat with a loss of confidence."No games, I promise," Harry smiled."I mean, 'friends' is a bit fast?" Draco asked uncertainly."He's been a slimy git!" Ron huffed; he quickly shut up after an elbow from Hermione."Well, perhaps schoolmates who have been through a lot together, " Harry suggested with a slight grin.Draco stared, wide-eyed at The Boy Who Lived Twice."Okay, Potter," Draco replied tentatively, slipping his hand into Harry's.Harry pulled him into a one-armed hug, "Let's get along as we should have, Draco,".Draco's face turned pink, "Alright, Harry,".They pulled out of their embrace, and Draco started to walk back to his lonely spot. "Where are you going?" Harry shouted. Draco turned around confused and pointed his thumb towards his table, where there sat a clean and empty plate.'You idiot Draco, now he's going to notice that you haven't fucking eaten anything!" Draco screamed internally."Come sit with us, you idiot! And let's get you to eat something, huh?" Harry invited, gesturing towards the trio's spot."Um, okay, I'll get my plate then," Draco replied, continuing to walk.While Draco was out of earshot, Ron was off the rails. "What the hell, Harry?! I don't like Malfoy. You don't like Malfoy, Hermione doesn't like Ma.." Hermione's interjection cut off Ron."I forgive Draco. You saw how much pressure he got from his parents; let's give him a chance,".Ron was about to disagree before Harry added, "And I also forgive Draco,"."But his father!" Ron argued."He is not his father, Ron," Harry sighed, "We've seen that,"."Why are you even doing this?" Ron said exasperatedly."Hermione and Miss Weasley got me to go to therapy. And I've learnt that forgiveness is necessary to heal," Harry said, fiddling with his sleeves. Ron stayed quiet. There was nothing he could say to that."I want to apologise. I was rude to you and your family. You as well, Hermione. I do sincerely wish you'll forgive me," Draco said, appearing out of nowhere, speaking a slight hint of nervousness in his voice."I forgive you, Draco, Ron does too, but it'll take him a little while to get used to that," Hermione giggled. Draco chuckled along."I'm assuming I shouldn't sit next to Weasley. Where should I sit?" Draco laughed. He hadn't felt this okay for a while."Well, Ron, can sit with Hermione, those two annoying lovebirds, and you can sit with me!" Harry concluded.They all shuffled into their new positions. "You and Ginny are annoying lovebirds too, though, aren't you?" Draco remarked, looking down the table at Ginny, who was sitting with the sixth years.Harry shuffled uncomfortably in his seat while Ron looked away.Hermione sighed. "They broke up,"."Oh, I'm sorry, Harry, why is that so?" Draco said apologetically. Now it was Harry's turn to look away and Ron's turn to shuffle."Well, Ginny's a lesbian...and Harry's bi," Hermione said quietly."Huh, alright, cool," Draco went back to pushing his food around his plate unemotionally."Uh, mate, did you hear what Hermione just said?" Ron asked, confused."Yeah, and?" Draco replied."You..you don't care?" Harry whispered. "Should I?" Draco answered nonchalantly."I guess not," Harry chuckled. Hermione smirked."You still keeping in touch with Pansy, Draco?" Hermione questioned, taking a sip of water."Ugh, no, she was annoying," Draco rolled his eyes while Hermione raised her eyebrow at Harry, knowingly, making Harry blush.***After a while of them talking, Ron eventually getting comfortable enough to join in, they were dismissed for the night. After they left the Great Hall, they said their goodbyes and the trio headed up to the Gryffindor common room, while Draco went down to the Slytherin common room.While walking through to the sleeping chambers, he saw a first-year having trouble with Wingardium Leviosa. Draco walked over with a friendly smile and offered his help. The first year, Avery Val, nervously accepted. After helping with her wand movements and her finally lifting a feather, he continued to the chambers. He was smiling to himself from the chattering of pleasant surprise among the first years back in the common area.After changing into his black silk pyjamas, he slipped into bed. Staring up at the ceiling, he heard his stomach growl. Thankfully, Harry forgot about Draco's empty plate.'Harry's bi, that's cool. I mean, it's not like I like him, right?' Draco thought to himself, thinking about all the times he obsessed over Potter, even when he "hated him". But that was a question for another day.Ignoring his hunger pains, Draco tossed and turned and fell into a deep slumber.

Chapter Text
Harry lay awake, unable to sleep, thoughts swirling around in his head. Some positive, like the fact that he had conciliated with Draco. But some negative, like the fact that Draco hadn't eaten anything. 'I'm sure it was nothing. Probably wasn't hungry,' He thought. Although, when he thought about it, he'd only ever seen Draco eat apples. 'I'll ask him about it tomorrow,', and with that, he soon fell into a dreamless sleep.***Draco, being Draco, was in the Great Hall before the three Gryffindors he sat with the night before. He assumed his position at the Slytherin table and filled his glass with water. 'Only water today, and if I'm good enough, I'll have an apple,' he thought to himself.After about nine glasses of water, the trio walked in; Hermione and Ron were laughing about something. Harry was as well, but he looked slightly serious, determined maybe. Draco glanced up at them before looking down again, not expecting to still be welcomed. Ron and Hermione sat down while Harry walked over to the Slytherin table. "You coming to sit with us?" He asked cheerfully. Draco was about to reply when he was interrupted by a sixth year Slytherin. "No, he won't; he is a Slytherin and should be loyal to his house!". This took Harry and Draco aback. After the war, all the houses had been pretty friendly to each other. "Well, I know that I'm loyal to my house, so I guess I'll sit here!" Harry exclaimed, not angrily, but sassily, "Guys! Let's sit here!" He called Ron and Hermione over, who had been watching. Hermione got up happily, pulling a reluctant Weasley along with her. Draco looked down at his glass, his face flushing. The three Gryffindors sat down, surprising most in the Great Hall. About halfway through breakfast, Harry leaned closer to Draco, "Aren't you going to eat?" He asked. Draco shook his head, "I'm not hungry; dinner filled me up," Draco replied. Harry raised his eyebrows and turned back to his plate. Hermione started a conversation about Potions, which Draco happily joined in on, not noticing that Harry was writing something on a piece of paper. Once they were dismissed for classes, Harry slipped the paper into his pocket. The first two classes were Defence Against The Dark Arts, which Harry and Ron were in, while Hermione and Draco had Arithmancy. After that, it was flying class with Madam Hooch, which the three boys shared. Because the year had just started, Madam Hooch hadn't quite finished her lesson plans, so they were all told to play a quidditch match. The class was divided into halves, which meant that Ron and Harry were on one team, whereas Draco was on the other. Harry and Draco were both seekers, and they both quickly spotted the snitch. They zoomed after it, Draco faster due to his lightweight. They were chasing the snitch upwards, and Draco was just about to catch it when everything went black. He slipped off of the broom and started hurtling towards the ground. Harry stared for a second, mortified, before zipping down to catch him. He reached out and grabbed the back of Draco's clothes and pulled him up before slowly going towards Madam Hooch, who was frantically running around. "Oh, he's fainted! Potter, help me get him to Madam Pomfrey!" She yelled, "The game goes on!" She said to the other students, all of which had not yet picked up their jaws from off the floor. *** Draco woke up to see Madam Pomfrey's kind but stern face. "W-What happened?" Draco asked tiredly. "You fainted hon, you're lucky Harry Potter caught you before you hit the ground. Now, have you been eating properly? Mr Potter told me he wasn't sure you ate," She replied. "Y-yeah, of course, I just didn't have breakfast because I was so full from dinner last night," Draco assured her, "Where's Harry? Can I go to class?". "Well, Harry left a minute before you woke up. He wanted to stay to make sure you were okay, but I had to make him go to his class. As for you, you're free to go at dinner. Your brain is too confused for you to go to class," Madam Pomfrey answered. "Okay, thank you, Madam Pomfrey," Draco said with a weak smile. "No problem, dearie, oh and Mr Potter left a note for you on your table," She said as she walked away to tend to her other patients. Draco curiously picked up the piece of paper lying on his table and unfolded it. It read: 
Meet me by the Grand Staircase before dinner 

-HP 
 Draco smiled at the letter, still confused. 'What does he want to talk about? Did I do something wrong? Does he hate me again?' These thoughts swirled around Draco's mind like a poison gas, a gas he couldn't escape, a gas that flooded his brain, and without even realising it, it was soon five minutes before dinner. He leapt out of the white, metal bed and rushed to Madam Pomfrey. "Madam Pomfrey, may I please leave now?". "I suppose, make sure you eat and drink lots of water!" She called out, because Draco started running towards the exit before she could fully reply. *** Harry stood by the staircase, nervous. He had been worrying about the blonde-haired boy all day; he almost pulled a Seamus on one of his potions. He heard the doors to the hospital wing swing open and the sound of a fast walk towards him. Harry looked up to, of course, see Draco. "You wanted to talk to me?" The thin boy said. "Yes. Draco, I don’t think I saw you eat dinner, and I definitely didn't see you eat breakfast. What's going on?" Harry asked with concern. "Nothing, I'm just tired, and that gave me a loss of appetite. I'm fine," Draco gulped. Harry didn't believe him but decided to let it go. He would be watching closely from now on, though. "Anything else, Mr Chosen One?" Draco giggled. Harry blushed. "No, that's all I wanted to talk about, shall we?" He gestured towards the Great Hall. Draco nodded gleefully, and they both walked to the Great Hall and towards where Hermione and Ron were sitting. As they sat down, Ron piped up, "I suppose we have dinner here and breakfast at the Slytherin table?". "I suppose so," Harry chuckled. They all smiled and went on to eat, well, all but Draco. "Draco, Madam Pomfrey recommended you eat," Harry said, frowning. "Um, well, after fainting, the last thing I want to do is eat. I think I might vomit," He lied. "Well, can you at least drink some water?" Harry pleaded. "Of course," Draco agreed, filling his glass with the ice-cold water from one of the pewter jugs. Hermione shot a concerned glance at Harry; he returned with a look that said, 'we'll talk about it later’. There was a lot of banter in the group that evening, with some jokes even being shared between Ron and Draco. Eventually, they were all dismissed from the Great Hall from the night. They all got up to leave, and once they were past the entrance, they all said their goodbyes. Ron was shaking Draco's hand and apologising for his coldness from yesterday when Draco noticed Harry and Hermione whispering to each other about something. They both walked over and surprisingly hugged Draco. Draco was amazed but hugged back happily. Needless to say, Draco went to sleep with happy thoughts that night. However, Harry was in a different position. After they heard the loud snores from Ron, Hermione and Harry both crept out to the common room, discussing Draco Malfoy. "You can feel his rib cage, Hermione!" Harry exclaimed. "I know, Harry! I'm worried too!" Hermione agreed. "What can I do?" Harry hopelessly asked, slumping further into the couch. "Maybe tomorrow you should try to get him to eat? Maybe ask him to try something from your plate that's good?" Hermione suggested. "That's a brilliant idea! But I'm not sure he'll eat it if it's from my plate," Harry mentioned. "That's what you think.. just try it, okay?" Hermione trailed off, beginning to stand up."Okay.." Harry said slowly. They both retreated to the sleeping chambers, Hermione falling asleep almost immediately, but Harry taking a little longer, restless from the worrying thoughts he had about Draco. In the end, he slept, still nervous about the path Draco was travelling down...

Chapter Text
Harry awoke the following day, with his mind blank for a second before being overwhelmed by the determination to get Draco to eat. Harry then slid on his glasses, shook Ron to wake him up and when he heard a groan, he started to change into his robes. During the flurry of black, red and yellow, he didn't notice Ron's infamous snores booming through the room again. Harry rolled his eyes and shook Ron awake again, slightly more violent this time. Ron mumbled a barely audible 'Fine. I'll wake up' before Harry started to walk down to the Great Hall.  Of course, the pale-faced Slytherin was there already, staring at his water glass before looking up to see Harry, which made Draco beam and wave him over. Harry cheerfully sat down next to Draco and piled food onto his plate. He noticed Draco eyeballing a piece of bacon like it was the first piece of food he'd ever seen.  Harry ate a piece of bacon before turning towards Draco with the piece of bacon his friend had been drooling over, "Here, Draco, have some! It's really good!" Harry offered gleefully.  Draco snapped out of his trance and muttered an answer, "Uh, that's okay, Harry. I already ate before you came here, so I'm full. Thanks anyway, though!". "Bullshit, Draco. Listen, I need you to eat, please! Just one grape!" Harry begged while holding out a grape.  "O-Okay, but I don't know why you're so bothered by it; I've already eaten," Draco laughed nervously. He began his ritual by cutting it into fourths with a knife.  Harry watched this unfold, astonished. Draco meticulously ate each fourth slowly, making sure to get around 32 chews. After the grape, he pretended to drink, but really he spat out the food he had chewed up. When Draco looked up to see Harry's proud, grinning face, he felt like sobbing. "I...I h-have to g-go. I'll s-see you in c-class," Draco spluttered as he ran off. *** Draco ran into the bathroom and splashed water on his face in an attempt to calm down. He was only whimpering now, but then he realised which bathroom this was. The bathroom that Harry Potter had almost killed him in. All the tears he was holding in burst out as he ran and locked himself in a stall, almost hugging the toilet seat.  Meanwhile, Harry had his head in his hands, being comforted by Hermione and Ron.  "I'm sure he's fine, mate! Maybe he got a piece of that grape lodged in his throat?" Ron said, trying to brighten up the situation. But all it achieved was a death stare from Harry. "Maybe...Maybe you should go after him? If he seemed that fragile, he'll probably want someone to hold him?" Hermione suggested. "You can't be serious 'Mione! Harry hugging Draco Malfoy?!" Ron protested, this time getting an even deadlier stare from Hermione. Harry stood up abruptly, "You're right, I'm going to go after him," and with that, he ran off. Harry was running through the halls, wondering where Draco could've gone. 'I'll never find him!' Harry thought, 'Hang on, the map!'. He pulled the tattered map out of the pocket in his robes and spoke the password, "I solemnly swear that I am up to no good,". The map soon appeared, and Harry scanned it for Malfoy's name.  Harry saw that he was in the bathroom, the one that he had almost killed Draco in. An overwhelming sense of guilt came over him. 'Running into that bathroom must have made him feel even worse! I have got to find him!'. Draco now had his head on the toilet lid, his wails echoing through the linoleum bathroom. He heard the door open and tried to silence his cries, but he just wasn't able to.  "Draco? Draco! Let me in, please!" Harry begged, banging on the stall door. Draco's crying stopped for a second as he opened the door, but as soon as he looked up from the ground to see Harry's worried face, he starting sobbing uncontrollably again.  "Fuck, Draco. You shouldn't be here. I'm going to take you to the Room of Requirement, okay?" Harry said softly. Draco just managed to nod before he was whisked away by Harry, who made sure to cast Muffliato so no one could hear Draco.  When they made it to the seventh floor, and Harry had walked past it three times thinking of what he needed, the door finally opened. They walked in to see a large but simplistic room. There was a mix of reds, blacks and greens, with a gigantic couch in the middle, bigger than a king-sized bed.  Harry sat Draco down on the couch and wrapped his arms around the crying Slytherin, pulling him into a warm, loving hug.  *** They sat like that for quite a while, which ran into their Potions lesson. When Draco had finally calmed down, his head was lying on Harry's chest while the raven-haired boy played with Draco's hair. Draco had been crying more since sixth year, and he'd never had anyone hold him.  "Shit, Harry! Class has started!" Draco exclaimed with panic, jumping off the couch. "I'm sorry, but I couldn't let you go while you were in that state," Harry explained tiredly, also getting off that couch. "You could have just left me! Don't sacrifice your learning for my stupid sake!" Draco argued, throwing his hands up in the air. "That's what friends do, Draco! That's what friends do.." Harry trailed off. "I-I'm sorry. I shouldn't have yelled at you. Thanks, Harry," Draco apologised softly.  "That's alright," Harry yawned, bringing Draco in for a quick hug, "I guess we should get going then?". Draco giggled and nodded. *** Harry and Draco both had Divination together, in which they were reading tea leaves. They were laughing at an impersonation Draco had done of Snape when Draco noticed a familiar symbol. He looked at it from all the angles he could and realised, "Hey Harry, from what I'm seeing, you're going to meet someone special!". Harry blushed, and Draco's heart lurched. 'He blushed! Does that mean he likes someone?!'. Draco got confused for a second; why did he care? It's not like he liked Harry or anything, right? *** Dinner rolled around, and Draco could feel Harry's hopeful gaze on him. Not wanting to see Harry disappointed in him, he ate, and he ate a lot. It was a binge, to say the least. The worst part for Draco was seeing Harry's beaming face, not knowing that Draco would throw it all up afterwards.  During dinner, Draco ate. Almost as much as Ron, actually. Harry shot a cheerful glance at Hermione, but it was not returned. Hermione was frowning at Draco's behaviour, which confused Harry but also made him slightly angry. 'Does Hermione want him to be starving? Does she want MY Draco to die?!' Harry thought. He gasped at himself; why did he call Draco his? Draco didn't like him, surely.  Everyone was dismissed from the Hall. They walked outside, Draco and Ron talking about Quidditch while Hermione pulled Harry aside.  "Harry, do not let Draco go to the bathroom alone tonight. Make sure you go with him," Hermione ordered.  "Why?" Harry asked, confused. "Just do it. If you hear him vomiting, make sure you stop him," Hermione said. "You mean to tell me that Draco might throw up his food?!" Harry exclaimed, being silenced by Hermione afterwards.  "Yes, but just please make sure you stay with him for at least an hour?" Hermione pleaded. "Of course 'Mione, thanks for the heads up," Harry agreed. They walked over to Draco and Ron, who was actually having a decent conversation. Ron and Hermione said their goodbyes to Draco and walked off, leaving Harry and Draco to themselves.  "Uh, Harry? Aren't you going to go to your dorm?" Draco asked. "I thought we could go to the Room of Requirement again?" Harry suggested innocently.  "Um, well, I gotta go to the bathroom first so.." Draco replied.  "Oh, okay. I'll wait for you then. Draco nodded, and they both headed towards the bathroom. Harry stood outside and waited until he heard Draco close a stall door. Harry silently crept in and listened closely. He heard gagging and then a trickle of liquid, which is when Harry banged on Draco's stall, begging him to stop.  Draco coughed and opened the bathroom door, "What?!" Draco asked as though he was surprised.  "Don't throw up, please!" Harry pleaded. Draco sighed and flushed the toilet.  He walked over to wash his hands at one of the basins, "I don't know what you're talking about, but okay," Draco lied. Harry rolled his eyes and pulled Draco out of the bathroom.  "Let's go,"  *** They spent what felt like an eternity in that room, talking about anything and everything that came to mind. They barely noticed it was midnight.  "Shit! If Filch finds us, we're dead!" Draco hissed.  "He won't find us. Here, I have my invisibility cloak," Harry pulled the cloak over the two of them.  "Now this, Potter, this is amazing," Draco muttered approvingly. They made it to their dorms safely, and both fell asleep as soon as their heads hit their pillows.

Chapter Text
Draco sat down at the Slytherin table, twirling around a gauntlet, face flushed as he thought about last night. 'Why am I so happy about this? We're just friends! God, Draco, pull yourself together!". He snapped into reality at the sudden bang as the Gryffindors sat down, Ron already tucking into the toast and bacon. "God, Weasley, do you have any table manners?" Draco scoffed.  "Draco, we've been asking the same thing since first year!" Hermione chortled. They all laughed at Ron's grunt of carelessness. "Hey Draco, we were making impressions on the way here, and Harry couldn't stop talking about how good your Snape was!" Hermione piped up, smirking at Harry. Draco laughed, then cleared his throat.  "Turn to page three hundred and ninety-four," Ron spat out his food in laughter, which made everyone laugh even harder.  "Harry can do quite a good you!" Ron said to Draco.  "Oh really? Let's hear it then," Draco said slyly, lifting his eyebrow at Harry.  Harry blushed, "Oh really? Let's hear it then," Even lifting his eyebrow at Draco as he had just done.  "God, is there anything the Golden Boy can't do?" Draco laughed. Harry muttered something to Hermione, and they both laughed.  "What?" Draco and Ron asked in unison.  "Oh, nothing. Come on, Ron, I have to help you finish your Potions essay,". Ron nodded, and they left, but not before Ron grabbed another two pieces of toast. "Shall we go to Potions then?" Draco asked after a moment of awkward silence.  "Yep,". *** After classes, Harry was frantically looking for Draco. Hermione had mentioned that she thinks Draco has an eating disorder which, for Harry, was the final puzzle piece in this mess of meals.  'Maybe I'll just go to the library; surely they have books about this in Hogwarts?' Harry rushed down to the library and started to rifle through books to find a proper one on eating disorders. He sat down and begun reading. Harry was about two thirds into the book when he was interrupted by a familiar voice, "Harry! Why...why are you reading that?" Draco asked nervously. Harry stood up and grabbed Draco's hand. "We need to talk,". Harry pulled him by harshly towards the exit, making Draco stumble and almost falling. Harry practically dragged him down to the lake. "Uh, Harry, what do we need to talk about?" Draco asked confusedly as he watched Harry breathe out with exhaustion.  "Why don't you eat?" He asked pointedly.  "Wh-What are you talking about? I eat!" Draco denied.  "I've only ever seen you eat apples, Draco! You have an eating disorder, do you?" Harry said sympathetically. Draco was silent for a moment before bursting out with rage, "Why do you care, Potter?! Surely you have other things to worry about! I'm fine, so sod off!". He sat down with his head in his hands, trying not to cry.  "Draco, I care about you because you're my friend. I'm not trying to hurt you. I just want to make sure you're okay," Harry said quietly, wrapping his arm around Draco's shoulders in empathy.  "I hate you so much, Potter. Do you want to know why?" Draco whispered.  Harry braced himself for heartbreak, "Why?". "I hate you because we have only been friends for three days, yet I already let my guard down around you. I hate you so much because no matter how hard I try, I can't stop trusting you and being comfortable around you," Draco said before bursting into tears. "Draco, I know this is new for you, but I want you to trust me; I really do. But trusting me means you have to let me help you. I promise I won't pressure you, but you need to get over your eating problems!" Harry comforted him. "Okay," Draco said quietly.  "Come on, let's go have dinner," Harry said, pulling Draco up by the hand. Although, on their walk back, they left their hands there to linger. ***Dinner went better than it could have. Harry persuaded Draco to eat four pieces of carrot. "Draco, you need to drink milk for calcium!" Harry whisper-shouted.  "Oh, so do you suppose I put one hundred milligrams in my cup, only to have everyone see me drink it and think that I'm an even bigger freak?" Draco retorted.  "You could always..drink a little bit from my cup?" Harry suggested.  "I guess I could," Draco complied and drank a tiny amount from Harry's gauntlet.  Harry beamed, which made Draco even happier.  *** "Hey, Draco, Room of Requirement?" Harry asked, lifting his eyebrow at him. Draco nodded, and they fled to the seventh floor.  "So, Harry, do you have a crush?" Draco wiggled his eyebrows, flopping onto one of the velvet couches the Room of Requirement had conjured. Harry felt a blush creep up his face, "Maybe," He answered shyly.  "Ooo, who is it?" Draco teased.  "Wouldn't you like to know, you sneaky little git," Harry laughed and lightly hit Draco's face with a pillow. Draco looked at his now messy hair in the mirror.  "Oh, it is on now, Potter!" Draco cackled.  Draco chased Harry around with a pillow, hitting him in the back until Harry tripped over a stray blanket. Draco seized the opportunity to straddle him and thrash his face with a green cushion. Harry laughed until Draco stopped after being too tired, which made Harry blush at their position.  Draco had noticed it too and successfully attempted to get off him with a 'no homo' attitude. "We should probably get going," Draco chuckled, holding out his hand for Harry to take. He accepted and was pulled up by a weak Draco who had only just managed to pull Harry off the ground.  "Do you have your cloak?" Draco asked.  "Oh shit, I don't!" Harry panicked for a second, "But I have this map," Harry said energetically as he pulled out The Marauder's Map.  They walked to the Gryffindor common room and said their goodbyes at the portrait. Draco began to walk to the Slytherin chambers, but as he was walking down a small set of stairs, he fainted. *** Harry had been watching Draco's dot on The Marauder's Map, worried for him as Draco had seemed exhausted. Draco's dot moved rapidly and was then still. 'He must be talking to one of the paintings,' Harry thought. But when the dot didn't move for another three minutes, Harry got worried. Harry threw on his invisibility cloak and crept out of the Gryffindor common room.   He rushed down to where Draco's dot was. He saw the pale boy splayed out across the stairs, body bruised and lip bleeding. "Shit, Draco!" Harry whispered. Harry couldn't bring him to Madam Pomfrey's, she would think that he has an eating disorder too, and Draco would hate Harry forever. But he didn't know the Slytherin common room password, and if he knocked, they would think that he had done this. The Room of Requirement is too far away; they would both be passed out when they reached it. Harry would have to carry him to the Gryffindor common room. They reached the room, and Harry laid Draco on the couch, Draco's head resting on Harry's chest. 'I'll just wait..just wait until he wakes..up' Harry lost his train of thought as he fell asleep.

Harry and Draco were in some sort of forest; they were lying on a blanket, Draco's head resting on Harry's belly. Suddenly, Draco sat up and pulled Harry's face to his by Harry's shirt collar. Their lips were millimetres away from each other. They leaned in and then-
 "Harry! What the bloody hell are you doing, mate?" Ron startled Harry awake.  "And Draco! What happened to you?" Hermione fussed. "Wh-what?" Harry rubbed his eyes and looked down at a confused Draco, "Oh! Draco fainted last night, so I carried him here, and I accidentally fell asleep," Harry admitted sheepishly.  "O-Oh. Sorry, Harry. I'll get out of your hair," Draco blushed and started to walk towards the exit. He wasn't very fast, though. He was still weak.  "Draco, you can't go out walking again like this. You don't have any strength!" Hermione blocked Draco's path.  "I-I'm fine, just tired," Draco sighed.  "Bullshit," Harry muttered.  "What was that, Harry?" Draco asked as Harry hadn't exactly spoken very loudly.  "I said that's bullshit. You weren't tired last night when you smashed my face with a pillow. Draco, I'm getting you some tea, okay? No sugar, just a little bit of milk," Harry said softly.  Draco nodded, "And for Merlin's sake, Malfoy, lie back down!" Ron added.  "That's surprisingly caring, Weasley," Draco chuckled as he lay down.  "You're lucky it's the weekend. People are sleeping in, so they couldn't have been able to see you. Well, not many, anyway," Ron said.  "Wait, people saw me! Here?! That could ruin someone's reputation, you know!" Draco exclaimed. "Well, if you talk that loud, more people will come down, so I'd be quieter. Plus, it's not as though ruining your reputation would be a bad thing for you anyway," Ron argued.  "It's not my reputation I'm worried about," Draco rolled his eyes, "it's Harry's! Rumours spread fast at Hogwarts, and plenty of people know Harry's bi, right? They're going to think he likes the death eater!" Draco reasoned. "But you're not a death eater anymore, are you?" Hermione said confusedly.  "Yeah, but how many people actually believe that?" Draco retorted sarcastically.  "Draco, I don't care if they think you're a death eater. Let rumours spread. Nobody said you couldn't deny them!" Harry said calmly, walking in with a cup of tea.   Draco immediately withdrew from his yelling and looked down. "You're right, Harry, sorry," Draco apologised.  Harry sighed, "That's fine, Draco, now could you please drink this?" He asked, setting the teacup down on a nearby coffee table.  "What are you guys doing up anyway?" Harry asked, sitting down next to Draco.  "Oh, um, it's Hogsmeade weekend, so we're going on a date at Madam Pudifoot's," Hermione replied, blushing.  "Ugh, I hate that place. It's so tacky and frilly," Harry pulled a revolted face.  "Well, apparently, someone helped redecorate it," Hermione retaliated. "Well, see you, I guess. Maybe at The Three Broomsticks?" Harry suggested. The two nodded and waved goodbye, then walked away. "Now, let's get you to drink this tea, hm?" Harry said, wrapping an arm around Draco's shoulders.  Draco picked up the tea, hands shaking as he brought it towards his mouth. "I-I can't," Draco said, pulling the cup towards his lap.  "Yes, you can, Draco," Harry encouraged, "I know you can,".  After much prodding, Draco finally finished the cup of tea in just over five minutes. "I'm so proud of you, Draco!" Harry cheered as he pulled the Slytherin into a tight hug.  "Thanks, Harry," Draco said shakily.  "Hey, wanna go to Hogsmeade?" Harry asked, with a hint of hope in his voice, "I need to go to Scrivenshaft's for some more ink,".  "Sure, meet me by the bridge?" Draco suggested.  "You bet," Harry responded. *** Harry walked down to the bridge, where Draco stood, clad in black. As they began to walk to Hogsmeade, Draco noticed Harry's outrageous clothes. "We need to go to Gladrags Wizardwear before anything else because if I'm going to be seen with The Chosen One, he needs to look his best," Draco sneered. "Is it really that bad?" Harry questioned. Judging by Draco's disgusted face, the answer was definitely a yes. They arrived at Hogsmeade, and conveniently, Gladrags was pretty empty because it was still early in the morning. They walked in and were greeted by the store clerk, Riras Cole. "Harry Potter! Lovely to see you again! Ah, I see you brought young Malfoy along with you! So what do we need? School robes?" He rambled.  "Actually, Mr Cole, Draco here has decided that I need to upgrade because my clothes are apparently horrible," Harry said.  "Well, Mr Malfoy surely has quite an eye. He's right. I'm sure you don't need me. Your friend seems to know exactly what to do with you," Riras winked and walked back to a shelf he was restocking. "Mr Cole is lovely, really. My father wasn't very nice to him, though.." Draco trailed off, "Anyway! let's get you looking sharp!" Draco quickly walked to the shirt section.  By the end of the shopping spree, the total cost came to around 25000 galleons, which Draco offered to pay for and wouldn't take no for an answer. "Mr Cole, do you mind if Harry changes his clothes in one of your changing rooms now?" Draco asked after paying. "Not at all!" Riras exclaimed cheerfully as he stored the money away. Draco stood outside the changing room, impatiently tapping his foot. When Harry walked out, he looked terrific. He was wearing a red cotton shirt, black slacks, black leather boots and a black coat with small gold embellishments on the collar. "Merlin's Beard, Harry! You look outstanding!" Draco's jaw dropped, making Harry blush.  "Thanks. Now can we go to Scrivenshaft's?" Harry pleaded. "Of course, let's go," *** After getting new ink, as well as a finely crafted green and black quill that Harry bought for Draco as a thank you gift, they walked to The Three Broomsticks to meet Hermione and Ron. When the two saw Harry, their eyes widened.  "Bloody hell, Harry! You look...you look..." Ron stuttered. "You look amazing, Harry! When did you get so fashionable?" Hermione finished Ron's sentence for him.  "This one," Harry pointed at Draco, "bought me a whole new wardrobe because I looked atrocious, according to him,". "You kind of did, mate," Ron admitted.  "Oh, like you're any better, Ron! But I can't give you a makeover; you'd look weird in better clothes," Hermione retorted, "You and I should go shopping together, Draco!".  "That..that would be nice, Hermione, thank you," Draco smiled.  "Jeez, Draco's straight, but he acts gayer than Harry," Ron joked.  Hermione elbowed Ron in the stomach, "Sod off, Ron. That's just some stupid stereotype," Harry said; he almost sounded upset, which made Draco angry.  It was confusing because it's not like he fancied Harry or anything. "Sorry Harry, Draco. I was just trying to joke around," Ron apologised.  "Well, maybe you should think before you speak, Ronald," Hermione said as she rolled her eyes.  "I'll get you a butterbeer, Harry," Draco offered.  "No, Draco, you've bought enough for me already. I'll buy myself one; do you want anything?" Harry asked. "Just a water, thanks," Draco replied. Harry smiled, nodded and walked away. "So, Malfoy, Quidditch?" Ron asked. *** The four were sitting around the fire in the Gryffindor common room. Every time a new person walked in, they stared at the sight. Hermione and Ron were sitting on a love seat together, which wasn't unusual. What was unusual was seeing Harry doing Charms homework while Draco Malfoy had his legs on Harry's lap, reading a book about runes.  Most of Gryffindor knew that Draco and the other three were friends now, but it was still rather strange.  Harry had just finished his essay and was now watching Draco read. Draco had a concentrating face that mesmerised Harry. He was lost in a trance until Draco snapped his fingers in front of the boy's face while Hermione and Ron chuckled at him. "What are you looking at, Potter?" Draco laughed. "O-Oh! I was just, um, reading the blurb on the back of your book!" Harry stuttered.  "It takes you a full minute to read four sentences?" Draco smirked.  "Well, it's just that runes are so boring, so I spaced out," Harry replied, yawning and moving so that he was lying down as well. Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes. "Harry, my footrest is gone!" Draco whined. Now it was Harry's turn to roll his eyes as he sat back up. "Yay!" Draco said with glee as he laid his head on Harry's lap.  "I thought you were putting your feet there!" Harry argued.  "Yeah, but I just realised I can rest my head here instead while using the armrest for my feet!" Draco replied heartily.  "Unbelievable," Harry murmured. It was nearing the student curfew when Harry and Draco realised the time. Hermione and Ron had already gone to bed, but Harry and Draco were too wrapped up in their conversation to notice.  "I'd better go," Draco said wearily as he got up to walk.  "Draco, I'm coming with you. I'll go under my invisibility cloak, sure, but just in case you faint again, okay?" Harry said with a worrisome but caring face.  "Fine," Draco said. They walked down, parting ways at the entrance to the Dungeon.  "I'll see you tomorrow, Malfoy," Harry joked. "Likewise, Potter,".

Chapter Text
Draco spent most of his nights with the trio in the Gryffindor common room. Doing homework, reading, talking etc. For the first time, Draco felt accepted for something other than his parents' status as death eaters. "Hey, Draco, what did you get down for the essay on social numbers (1)?" Hermione asked as she finished writing her own.  "Come here, and I'll show you," Draco offered.  "Can't you come over here?" Hermione groaned.  "But I'm too comfortable," Draco whined.  Currently, Draco was lying across Harry's lap, using Wingardium Leviosa to play with Harry's fringe, who was sleeping. All of a sudden, Draco screamed and was on the floor. Harry woke up, "What are you doing down there?" Harry yawned, rubbing his eyes.  "You almost drooled on me, Potter!" Draco screeched.  "You might as well come over here now," Hermione said smugly. Draco sighed and stood up. He snatched up his parchment, glaring at Harry as he did so, before trudging over to Hermione. While they were comparing their essays, Ron was telling Harry what he was laughing about. "You shoulda seen 'im, Harry; he was just lying across your lap and making your hair dance!" Ron could barely finish telling Harry about it before bursting out with laughter that had somehow gotten louder. "Hey, Weasley, it was almost as funny as when you made yourself puke slugs," Draco jeered, making Hermione snort.  "Nah, what's even funnier is when Mad-Eye turned you into a ferret," Ron retorted. Surprising everyone, Draco growled and then turned back to Hermione to compare calculations.  Harry laughed softly at first, but then it suddenly got louder. Draco scoffed and turned to Harry, "What's so funny?" Draco asked.  "It's just..you growled like a ferret," Harry could barely breathe; he was laughing so hard. Ron joined in after Harry's answer. Draco rolled his eyes and pulled out his wand. He turned to Hermione and whispered something. They both nodded and turned towards the laughing boys without them noticing.  The two waved their wands and muttered, "Flipendo,". All of a sudden, the laughter died down after the two boys were thrown backwards. Now it was Hermione and Draco's turn to laugh hysterically. The boys sat up with scowls on their faces before joining in on the laughter. The nights like those were the best Draco had had in a while, for Harry as well. The next day, though, was unbelievably shitty. *** Draco awoke in his sleeping chambers. Rubbing his eyes, he slipped into the bathroom and locked the door. He walked over to the scale. It read 40 kg. Draco had reached his goal weight! But when he looked in the mirror and undressed, all he saw was fat, and how he looked mattered more than weight.  He would have to stop complying with Harry to maintain his weight and shed the tubs of lard he was storing. While Draco was getting dressed, another boy was awake, distraught. 'Draco seemed really on edge last night..' Harry thought, 'I guess I'll have to ask him about it at breakfast'. So that they could have some time alone, Harry got dressed, knowing that the Slytherin would already be there when he arrived. "Hey," Draco said, unusually quiet and without his Malfoy flair.  "Hi. Are you alright?" Harry asked.  "Yeah, I'm fine, just tired is all," Draco yawned as if to prove his point.  "You'd tell me if something was bothering you, wouldn't you?" Harry pressed on, concerned.  "Maybe," Draco replied smugly, "Why so obsessed, Potter?".  "Don't flatter yourself, Malfoy," Harry rolled his eyes and acted confident, although the redness creeping up to his cheeks told a different story.  Suddenly, a loud bang startled all the students in the hall, but when they looked to see who it was, all they saw was a ladybug, being chased by a fretful Hermione.  "You come right here, you loathsome beast!" Hermione screamed. Draco was confused, yet Harry seemed to know what was going and quickly hit the bug with Rictusempra. The puny creature fell to the ground, and Hermione seized the opportunity to catch it in a jar, making sure to screw the lid tightly.  "What?" Draco asked, with a lot of shock and confusion on his face.  "You know Rita Skeeter?" Harry asked. Draco nodded. "Well, we found out she's an animagus. That's how she seems to know everything that goes on," Harry explained.  "Well, what story do you think she was after?" Draco questioned, understanding slightly but still bewildered.  "Good question! Hermione! What was she looking for this time?" Harry called across the tables. Hermione walked over and sat down.  "You two," She replied, clearly out of breath.  "What?!" Draco exclaimed.  "She saw you two together, and of course, the Golden Boy in love with the 'evil Slytherin' would make a good title," Hermione said, before looking back at the jar with a revolted look on her face.  Harry and Draco both shook their heads in disbelief. "Well, I should probably put her back and wake Ron up, see you," Hermione waved as she walked off. "Okay, what are we eating today?" Harry asked. There were mountains of food that Draco could have chosen, but instead, he pointed at his water-filled gauntlet. "Draco.." Harry trailed off.  "Maybe one-third of an apple," Draco added.  All of a sudden, Harry slammed his hand on the table, making Draco jump slightly, "Come on, you've come this far, Draco, don't ruin it!" Harry protested.  "Well, excuse me, Mr Perfect, sorry I seem to ruin all your fun!" Draco spat, grabbing his books and walking away. Instead of going after him to apologise, Harry sat in silent fury. 'How could Draco do this to me? I’ve tried so hard, and now it's all about to be wasted because Draco doesn't want to eat!' Harry thought maliciously, thank god Hermione came in time to set him straight.  "You told him what?!" Hermione shouted in disbelief. People looked over as Harry shushed her, casting Muffliato immediately.  "Yes, but he's ruing the progress that we've made! He's throwing away all the hard work I put into it!" Harry complained.  "Harry, it may be tough getting him to eat, but you've got to remember that it's even harder for him to eat! You read a book, didn't you? Eating disorders can alter emotions, Draco probably didn't want to insult you, but he can't help it! You can," Hermione threw her hands up, tired of explaining everything to everyone.  "Fuck, what have I done?" Harry's head sunk further until he was face was flat against the table.  "We'll see him in Potions. You can apologise to him there," Hermione reminded him.  Harry did just that, or at least, he tried to. *** Harry walked into Potions, nervous. He sat down next to Draco and tried to smile. "Hey, um, Draco.." Harry started to talk when Draco glared at him, "I-I just wanted to say..that I'm sorry," Harry stammered.  "Oh? Was my 'outburst' not good enough either?" Draco sneered.  "Wh-What? I didn't mean it like that! I'm just sorry for my rudeness!" Harry tried to explain desperately.  "Just shut up, Potter and let me learn in peace," Draco's words cut through Harry's heart like knives.  ~~ Harry didn't speak to Draco for the rest of the day, thinking that at dinner, he would have cooled off. Draco, however, was dying to talk to Harry. But having that Malfoy grandeur, he needed for Harry to speak first.  At dinner, Harry tried again, "Draco, I'm sorry, can we please put this behind us?" Harry asked with hopefulness.  "Of course," Draco accepted, going back to drinking water.  "But..Draco...please can you eat, maybe half an apple, please?" Harry begged.  "No, thanks," Draco dismissed, shooing Harry away. Harry tugged lightly on Draco's robe, looking up at him with puppy dog eyes once the blonde had turned around. Draco sighed and grabbed a green apple out of the bowl. He brought it to his spotless plate and cut it into fourths, then popped it into his mouth, chewing thirty-two times.  "Thank you," Harry said and turned to join Ron in a conversation about the possible new flavours of Jelly Slugs, while Draco joined Hermione in a discussion about Futhark (2). After dinner, Draco slipped down to the quidditch pitch to burn off the few calories in that small piece of apple. Harry, of course, noticed that his newest infatuation was gone and checked the map. Draco was just finishing his first lap (as the quidditch pitch is quite large) when Harry yelled out, "Draco! What the hell are you doing?!".  "What does it look like?" Draco rolled his eyes, "I'm running, duh,". "Why? It's freezing! Not to mention, dark!" Harry argued.  "Helps me clear my head," Draco lied, slightly gulping.  "I guess I'll run with you then. I could use a clear mind right now," Harry said cheekily.  "Try and catch me, Potter," Draco teased and started to sprint away. Harry shook his head and ran after him. It didn't take very long for Draco to lose energy, given the fact he had barely eaten anything all day, so they both slowed down to a jog and, eventually, a calm and peaceful walk.  A lot of laughs and carefree voices were carried through the air that night. Little did the two boys know, but a curly-haired girl was looking through the window. Hermione was smiling at the two, one who knew they fancied the other, one who didn't know just yet.  'They'll come together soon,' She thought. ***  (1) an arithmancy factor that represents an outer personality (2) the runic alphabet

Chapter Text
Draco woke the following day with unbearable pains in his bones, especially the legs and back. How was he supposed to get to the hospital wing if everyone in his dorm had left? There wasn't a house-elf he could call for, nor an owl he could send a letter with. Maybe he should wait; maybe his friends will notice he's gone and will come to get him. Harry was sitting at the table, being comforted by Hermione while Ron sat there, confused about why Harry was so worked up about this. "It's just Malfoy, mate! Maybe he slept in!" Ron said.  Harry pounded his fist on the table and looked up to stare at Ron, "Have you ever seen Draco here after everyone else?! I don't think Draco has ever slept in!" Harry yelled, attracting almost everyone's gaze from around the hall. With a quick glare from Hermione, though, everyone else turned back to their meals. "Well, I've never tried to look for Malfoy, so why would I have noticed?" Ron asked, dumbfounded.  "Harry's right, Ron! Please, just be quiet!" Hermione begged exasperatedly. Ron held up his hands in surrender and wolfed down more eggs. "Maybe we should go see if he's okay?" Hermione suggested, "We know where the entrance is, so it shouldn't be too hard,". "You two stay here; I'll go after him," Harry stood up abruptly.  "What if somebody sees you?!" Ron interjected.  "Cloak," Harry rolled his eyes and walked off. Harry walked up to the entrance and knocked after throwing on the invisibility cloak. A sixth year opened the door, expecting to see someone. While they were looking around, Harry quickly sneaked in and stole away up to the sleeping chambers.  He opened the door to find Draco curled up in his bed, whimpering. Harry pulled off the cloak and rushed to Draco's side. "Draco! Are you okay? What's wrong?" Harry whispered.  "My b-bones, I c-can't move," Draco stuttered. "Fuck, okay, I'll carry you out, okay?" Harry picked up the groaning Draco and carried him to the hospital wing.  Once again, he tore off his cloak and rushed through the door. "Madam Pomfrey! Quick! Draco needs help!" Harry shouted, carrying him over to a bed. Madam Pomfrey hurried over and immediately started asking questions. Draco simply winced in pain. "His bones, he can't move," Harry answered for him.  "Oh, dear. Mr Potter, would you please step aside so I can get a closer look?" Madam Pomfrey fussed. Harry moved around to sit in a chair on the other side.  "Will he be okay?" Harry asked worriedly.  "Yes, but he will need to stay here for at least two days, and afterwards, he needs to have a calcium-centred diet," Madam Pomfrey said, bringing relief to Harry's face, yet horror to Draco's.  Madam Pomfrey walked away to get an assortment of replenishing potions while Harry sat with Draco. "Harry, do you know how many calories are in things with calcium?" Draco said quickly, "I'm going to get so fat, and I won't have friends anymore, and my father will hate me even more and-" Harry cut off Draco.  "If you don't eat or drink calcium, you'll have to stay here for longer, and what do you mean by fat? Draco, you're incredibly skinny, unhealthily skinny. In fact," Harry said, concern lacing his face.  "Don't you see this?!" Draco pulled up his shirt and pinched a bit of skin, although you could barely see it. What you could see, though, was clear outlines of his rib cage and hip bones.  "Draco!" Harry covered his mouth in horror. Draco slowly pulled his shirt down in confusion. Madam Pomfrey came back, arms full of bottles.  "Mr Potter, class," She said sternly. Harry nodded, taking the late note that Madam Pomfrey held in her hand. Before leaving, he stole one more glance at the skeletal boy lying down.  *** After all the concoctions and milk Draco was forced to consume, he, of course, fell asleep almost straight away. He woke up to see a distraught Hermione and Ron standing to the left of him. He felt a soothing touch on his hand and looked to his right. Harry held onto Draco's hand as though it was a life source, rubbing his thumb in a circular motion on top of Draco's hand. "Wh-What are you all doing here?" Draco asked, his eyes still adjusting to the harsh lights.  "Well, we all have a free period, so we came to see you; make sure you're okay," Ron spoke up, surprising the others.  "Oh, well, thanks, guys," Hermione and Ron nodded with slight smiles on their faces.  "How are you?" Harry whispered, finally looking up to meet Draco's eyes.  "Less sore now. How are you, Harry?" Draco replied. Harry grunted ad Draco looked to Hermione for answers.  "He's been reticent today. He's very worried. We all are," Hermione said sadly.  "Sorry.." Draco trailed off, looking at the bags under Harry's eyes.  "We'd love to stay Draco, but Ron and I have classes, we'll check up on you before and after dinner," Hermione said awkwardly.  "Get better soon!" Ron called out as the two walked away.  Draco looked back to Harry, "Don't you have class?".  "Double free period," Harry said, his words barely audible.  "Merlin's Beard, Harry, you need to rest," Draco argued.  "I'm sitting down, aren't I?" Harry said with the slight hint of a smile.  "You need to lie down," Draco rolled his eyes.  "I'm not allowed to just steal beds, Malfoy," Harry replied cheekily.  "Ugh, fine, at least rest your head," Draco sighed, patting next to him. Harry leaned his head against the firm mattress, reaching out his hand.  "What, Potter?" Draco asked.  "Give me your hand," Harry whined. Draco rolled his eyes and slipped it into Harry's.  The two stayed like that for a while, eventually falling asleep, only awoken when Madam Pomfrey brought Draco and Harry's dinner.  "That's a lot for one person, Madam Pomfrey," Draco said, staring at the food.  "Don't be silly. Mr Potter doesn't seem content with leaving, so I thought I'd bring you both dinner," She huffed.  "Oh, you didn't have to do that, Madam Pomfrey, thank you very much," Harry apologised. She walked away, and Harry turned to Draco. They both sat there, silently, tension filling the air. "Please, Draco?" Harry asked quietly.  Draco sighed and slowly began to eat, thirty-two chews a bite. Harry ate at the same pace, making sure that nothing suspicious happened.  They sat there, just eating. It was a comfortable silence. You could even say it was a slightly loving silence. "Draco?" Harry finished his meal.  "Hm?" Draco sipped his milk, "What's wrong?".  "It's just, do you think that me, encouraging your exercise last night, is mostly why this happened?" Harry asked nervously. "Harry...of course not, this was a long time coming, don't worry," Draco assured.  "Draco, I really want you to get better, you know that, right? I'm ready to help you, but if this gets too out of hand, then I have to tell Madam Pomfrey," Harry said.  Draco nodded, understanding that it would have to be done, but wishing it didn't. The two looked into each other's eyes before being interrupted by the doors suddenly opening. Hermione and Ron walked over. "How are you feeling, Draco?" Hermione inquired anxiously.  "Better," Draco said confidently.  "You look better, Harry. Did you have a nap?" Ron mentioned.  Harry blushed, and Hermione smirked, "Uh, yeah," Harry chuckled nervously.  "We brought Exploding Snaps?" Hermione offered.  *** Having fun with each other made Draco forget about the calories, pain and dullness of the hospital wing. It made Harry forget about Draco's eating disorder, Draco's pains and every other worry Harry had. It also reminded them all that this is how it could have been if there was less prejudice.  Eventually, the time came for Hermione and Ron to leave, including Harry, if he hadn't been so insistent.  "Please, Madam Pomfrey, I've been worried sick all day, and I know that if I leave, I'll be worried again, and I won't sleep," Harry pleaded. Not wanting to jeopardise Harry's health or sleep hygiene, Madam Pomfrey agreed to let him stay.  "You're lucky, Mr Potter. I have a spare bed that I can place next to Mr Malfoy's" She sighed and walked off.  "I wasn't expecting to have to sleep next to you," Harry complained in mock disgust. Draco scoffed at Harry as Madam Pomfrey walked in, levitating a bed and placing it next to Draco's. "I expect no funny business, you two," She warned.  The two boys blushed, "Oh um, it's n-not like that we're uh just friends," Harry stammered.  "Okay," Madam Pomfrey said suspiciously, peering at them out of the corner of her eye as she walked away.  The two looked at each other and burst out laughing. "We should probably sleep now," Harry said after a couple of minutes of them talking and joking around. Draco nodded and went to turn the light off.  Due to the long and stressful day, the boys fell asleep almost immediately.  Although they originally started their slumber with their backs turned, come morning, they would find themselves entangled in a cuddle. With their hands clasped tightly together and sharing the same pillow.

Chapter Text
Draco's eyes fluttered open. Blinking, he wondered why the light was so dull until he realised a sleeping Harry blocked the lights. Draco's eyes widened as he looked at their position. Legs interlocked, hands together, faces only a couple inches away from each other. Even if he were not captivated by Harry's face, he still wouldn't have woken him up. This was too precious.  Draco barely noticed Harry open his eyes. "Merlin's Beard, Draco, you blend in with the bed," Harry said tiredly. Draco scoffed and rolled his eyes, even though it was true. If it weren't for Draco's hair and his complexion comparison to Harry, someone would mistake him for part of the crisp white sheets against an almost whiter mattress. "Well, sleep was comfortable, huh?" Harry asked cheekily. " Too comfortable, by the looks of it," Draco agreed. They lay there, daring each other to move with their eyes, although none of them did.  "Good morning, boys," The two broke out of their trance by the sudden voice.  "Mr Potter, you may have breakfast here, but you have to go to classes," Madam Pomfrey said sternly. Harry went to argue, but she cut him off, "If there is any bad news about Mr Malfoy, I will tell you,". Harry nodded gratefully and turned to the breakfast Madam Pomfrey had set on a table near them.  Without Harry needing to remind him, Draco was already tucking into his breakfast. Harry smiled and ate along with him. Even while they were eating, their hands remained together, only moving to cut a piece of bacon every once in a while. Harry eventually had to leave, making Draco sad, which was very confusing. Harry was just his friend. He didn't like him, right? 'Now that I think about it, we're pretty touchy, aren't we? And he seems to cloud all my thoughts, maybe...do I really?!' Draco's jaw dropped as he realised, "I fancy Harry Potter!" He whispered to himself.  Unbeknownst to him, Madam Pomfrey was smiling to herself, now sure that she was right. Professor Sprout owed her five knuts. *** Meanwhile, Hermione was trying to calm Ron down. You see, Harry had decided that Ron was ready to know about who he fancied, but Ron wasn't prepared. "I mean I support you, mate, for sure but..seriously?! Malfoy?!" Ron huffed.  "I can't help it, Ron. Anyway, Draco doesn't like me back, so it's not like anything will happen," Harry said, a piece of his heart being torn off as he said it. "Oh, as if Harry! You and Draco are curled up every second of the day! He so likes you back!"  Hermione argued.  "I don't want to believe it but, she's right 'Arry," Ron reluctantly agreed.  "We've seen the way you look at him," Hermione said. "You guys really think I have a chance?" Harry asked quietly. The two nodded.  "Take it slow though, Draco probably won't be ready yet," Hermione mentioned. With a simple nod of agreement, the trio focused on their work. Harry quickly ate his lunch, then hurried to the Hospital Wing. Draco looked up with a happy yet nervous smile. "How are you feeling?" Harry asked, straight to the point.  "A hello would've been nice. I'm feeling much better," Draco replied.  "Ha, sorry, hi Draco," Harry chuckled.  "Hey," Draco said back, blushing. 'He looks adorable when he laughs,' Draco thought. He quickly composed himself, 'I can't let Harry know!'.  "So, how were your classes?" Draco asked, then cursed himself because when has he ever cared?  "Oh, um, they were fine. How has the um, hospital been?" Harry replied, surprised at Draco's uncharacteristic question.  "Ugh, boring as ever," Draco rolled his eyes.  "I would skip for you, but I have a test in Potions," Harry said. "You..you would?" Draco asked, looking up with a glimmer of innocence in his grey eyes.  "I mean..yeah. You're sick, and you're my friend, so.." Harry said, mesmerised by Draco's adorable expression.  "Oh, okay. Thanks, I guess," Draco said, disappointed in the use of the word 'friend'.  "I wish you were in Potions today. I don't have my knight to let me cheat off of him," Harry whined.  "I never let you cheat! Why would you cheat?!" Draco exclaimed.  "Because, to get an Auror position, I need to of gotten an exceeds expectations in Potions," Harry replied, shrugging his shoulder.  "An Auror? Harry, if you want to become an Auror, it'd be a good idea to actually find out the answers, so you're actually successful in your career," Draco argued.  Harry's smile dropped slightly, "Oh shit, you're right," Harry said awkwardly.  "I wasn't expecting that big of a reaction, but okay," Draco joked, "but, you know, I could tutor you, Harry? Maybe just help you with some stuff?".  "Merlin's Beard, Draco! Would you really?!" Harry said excitedly. Draco nodded.  "Thank you so much!" Harry pulled Draco into a tight hug. Draco blushed at the sudden contact. "Where are Weasley and Granger?" Draco asked. He would never admit it, but he liked seeing them.  "They're doing 'homework'," Harry said and winked. Draco started to imagine what it would be like if he and Harry were like Ron and Hermione..before quickly bottling up those thoughts for another time.  "So..anything specific you want to revise for the test?" Draco asked.  "Oh, yeah! The test is mostly about elixir to introduce euphoria, so," Harry replied cheerfully. Draco nodded and started flipping through pages in a textbook to find revision. *** Draco was ecstatic. 'One more night of this, and then I'm out of here! Calcium, my ass! Although, I will miss sleeping next to Harry..' Draco thought. "Speak of the devil," He murmured as Harry walked through the doors, Hermione and Ron trailing after him.  "Hey, Draco!" Harry greeted, waving, making Draco's face flush because 'Oh my god, he's so cute!'.  "Sorry we didn't come at lunch," Hermione apologised.  "That's okay. I understand that homework for 'snogging class' is essential," Draco retorted sassily. The couple's faces turned beet red, and they laughed nervously.  "We brought Snitch Snatcher! Wanna play?" Ron quickly changed the subject.  "You're on, Weasley," Draco grinned. *** "Bull!" Ron whinged as Hermione dragged him away. He had lost to Draco through his cheating, according to Ron.  "Mr Potter? I assume you're sleeping here again?" Madam Pomfrey asked, scaring the two boys as she appeared out of nowhere.  "Um, yeah. Sorry, Madam Pomfrey," Harry scratched the back of his neck. Her lips pressed into a thin line, and she squinted her eyes.  "You're lucky that this is Draco's last night here," She muttered as she walked away. Harry turned to look at Draco with a mock-guilty look on his face. "What are you going to do when I have to sleep back in my own dorms, Mr Potter," Draco teased and lifted his eyebrow.  Harry pretended to clutch his chest in agony, "Oh, Draco, I don't know what I'll do! How could I live without you?" Harry jokingly wailed.  Draco rolled his eyes, "Am I really that bad, Potter?". "No, you're perfect," Harry admitted.  "O-Oh..thank you," Draco said, eyes wide. They sat there in awkward silence. "Well, we should probably get to sleep!" Draco said quickly and turned around to turn the lamp off.  "Yup," Harry replied anxiously as he turned around to face away from Draco.  Yet again, they were soon entangled in an embrace that made you wonder how they had absolutely no clue that their feelings were returned.

Platinum blonde hair that seemed to fall into place no matter what perfectly. Deep, grey eyes. Pale skin. An adorable nose and ears. Sharp and defined jawline. A somehow cute adam's apple. Harry studied Draco's features as the thin boy slowly ate his breakfast. "Potter? Potter!" Draco exclaimed, snapping his fingers in front of Harry's face.  "Hm? Oh, sorry," Harry chuckled nervously.  "Like what you see?" Draco smirked and lifted his eyebrow.  "Ha, yeah, sure," Harry laughed dismissively.  Draco blushed and quickly turned his attention back to the piece of bread he had been poking at. "C'mon, Draco. It's the last thing. I know you can do it," Harry encouraged softly. The other boy slowly began reaching his fork towards it, hands trembling. Harry enveloped Draco's hand in his own, nodding when Draco looked at him. The Slytherin sighed and pierced his fork through the bread, Harry squeezing Draco's other hand as he did so. He quickly shoved the bread into his mouth and begun his ritual of 32 chews.  Harry rubbed Draco's shoulders in support, giving Draco one of the greatest senses of relief he'd ever had. "You excited to go back to classes?" Harry asked.  "Definitely. He's a bit annoying, but I did miss Professor Slughorn," Draco admitted.  "Whoa, that was a rhetorical question, you nerd," Harry teased. Draco rolled his eyes and scoffed.  "Alright, now go away back to your dorm and get your books, you git," Draco shoved Harry off the bed.  Harry smirked, "Already got them," He pointed to his books sitting on a bedside table.  "Fine, I'll just go get my books then," Draco huffed and began to walk off.  "Draco, wait! I'll come with you," Harry called out, running up to him.  "Fine, but try to keep your eyes off of me while we're out in public," Draco said coolly and went back to walking away. Leaving Harry shocked at Draco's flirty remark while the other internally screamed at himself for saying it. The two arrived at the Slytherin common room, surprising all the Slytherins when Harry Potter walked in with Draco Malfoy. Draco quickly organised his books and parchment and quills into a satchel. He hoisted it onto his shoulder and turned to leave. "Hey, Draco, let me carry that for you," Harry offered, not wanting Draco to faint again.  "Uh, okay. Don't drop it, though, Potter," Draco accepted.  The boys walked to Potions just in time. "Alright. Today we will be revising how to make Amortentia. Please partner up," Professed Slughorn ordered cheerfully. Naturally, Hermione and Ron had already chosen each other, leaving Draco and Harry to select each other.  "Maybe you should just watch. I don't need a failing grade, thank you very much," Draco sneered.  "Fine, I'll do the writing then," Harry rolled his eyes.  "Make sure the handwriting is legible, please," Draco added, earning another eye-roll from Harry. Once the potion was finished, the two had to smell it in order to write down the effects. "You go first, Harry," Draco said, taking a step back.  Harry leaned over the cauldron and sniffed, "I smell...treacle tart...a broomstick handle and..uh nothing else," Harry blushed, not willing to say that he smelt Draco's hair.  "Shit, you're usually supposed to smell at least three things. I must've done it wrong. What stupid thing did I do?" Draco cursed himself. Seeing the disappointment in Draco's eyes, he had to tell the truth.  "Oh! I uh smell something else!" Harry piped up, Draco whipped his head around in hope. "Um..your shampoo...I think," Harry admitted, quickly looking away. Draco nodded, not knowing what to say. Harry gestured to the cauldron, and Draco smelled the potion.  "I smell, um, tea...toast and, uh, your cologne.." Draco trailed off. Harry stared at him, wide-eyed.  "I, uh, I need to go," Draco said, quickly scribbling his name on the parchment Harry had written the report on and handing it to Professor Slughorn before sprinting out of the classroom.  As he ran towards the castle's exit, he heard the click-clacking of shoes running after him. Draco ran faster towards the forbidden forest, only stopping to climb a tree and disappearing from sight. Draco sat on a broad branch and cried as he gripped the sides of his hair.  Harry stopped under a tree when he heard a familiar cry. Looking around, he couldn't see the boy that he was looking for. Harry felt a drop of rain on his head, yet when he looked up, he realised it was Draco's tears. Harry quickly climbed the tree to where Draco was sobbing. "It's alright, Draco, it's alright," Harry whispered as he pulled Draco in.  Draco wept onto Harry's shoulder for a while before finally pulling away. "I'm sorry, I got your robes wet," Draco sniffled.  "I'm not bothered. We can stay here for the rest of the day if you want," Harry suggested. Draco nodded, leaning his head against Harry's shoulder once again. *** Eventually, they went back to the castle for lunch. "Hey, guys, where were you?" Ron asked while eating.  As Draco wrinkled his nose in disgust, Harry answered, "Free periods,". This wasn't a lie, Harry did have free periods, and none of the others had Transfiguration with Draco anyway.  The boys sat down, Harry piling food onto his plate, while Draco was a little more hesitant. Harry looked deep into Draco's grey eyes, conveying a look of encouragement. Draco sighed and gathered some food with calcium in then. Four pieces of cheese on the top left corner of his plate, four teaspoons of yogurt on the bottom left, four almonds on the top right and four soybeans on the bottom right. Hermione and Ron looked at Draco's weirdly organised plate in curiosity, while Harry slowly rubbed in circles on the back of Draco's shoulder.  Slowly, Draco began eating, 32 chews a bite. Hermione and Ron quickly turned their attention towards each other, but Harry stayed focused on Draco. He focused on Draco for a long time. To their dismay, they had no classes together for the second half of the day, and Draco was pulled aside for the assignments he had missed a lot during dinner. They barely had enough time to hug goodbye awkwardly! Draco was dreaming about his lavish lab partner, not knowing that approximately one minute later, he would be woken up by knocking on the Slytherin Common Room entrance. Sleepily, Draco got out of bed and walked down to the door. When he opened it, a shaking, paranoid Harry Potter was standing there. "Harry? What's wrong?" Draco asked hurriedly, closing the door behind him.  "The w-war, s-so many people d-died for m-me!" Harry spluttered. Draco quickly whisked Harry to a secluded part of the dungeon and sat him down.  Harry buried his head into Draco's chest as he cried, Draco patting his head and whispering, "Shh, it's alright. Nobody blames you. Nobody's angry at you,". After a while, Harry's shaking and crying had died down, and the two were just cuddling. Harry slowly got up, extending his hand down to Draco, who accepted.  "Well, today's been an emotional rollercoaster, huh?" Harry chuckled weakly.  "Heh, yeah," Draco agreed, although not entirely sure on what a rollercoaster was.  "I guess I'll...see you tomorrow then?" Harry asked. Draco nodded, and the two walked away.

Chapter Text
Anger. Pure, fiery anger. That's all Draco felt at the moment. The number on the scale had gone up, he was clearly fatter, and the skin he could pinch upwards was more than usual. Was this Harry Potter's sick plan? To make Draco an ugly, fat mess? Of course, Draco still loved him, but right then, he didn't like him.  Draco stormed to class an hour early. No way was he eating breakfast at this weight. Nor did he want to see the boy he hated that made his knees weak and his heart flutter. Thankfully, he had double Transfiguration, then a free period and then double Arithmancy with Hermione, who he didn't mind seeing as she was quite clever.  It was tough to concentrate on what Professor McGonagall was saying, as his mind was at a crossroads. Was Harry just trying to sabotage Draco's progress and fucking with his feelings? Or does Harry care about Draco and just wants him to get better.  Draco's logical side told him that it was obviously the latter because he knew logically that starving himself was stupid. However, the side of Draco that was under the control of his disorder told him that Harry was just another enemy. Before Draco knew it, Transfiguration had finished, and it was now lunch, which Draco would much rather spend walking around the quidditch pitch.  Draco was completing his third lap when he heard the familiar voices of Harry, Hermione and Ron. "Harry, maybe he just wants to be left alone!" Hermione argued.  "Yeah, mate, I'm sure it's nothing," Ron agreed.  "You guys don't get it at all! You have no idea what happened yesterday and how worried I am! I bet you he's here exercising!" Harry bellowed. Draco quickly booked it towards one of the box stands and hid. "See Harry! He's not here! I have Arithmancy with him later, and I'll check up on him, okay?" Hermione said, her voice getting softer. Harry let out a grunt of acceptance, yet also frustration. As their voices got quieter and quieter, then inaudible, Draco slipped back out. Harry probably didn't care. He just wanted to make Draco worse. With a triumphant sigh, Draco began walking again. *** His free period was spent in the Forbidden Forest, on a tree, with a deathly silence. Draco was numb, essentially. He could barely feel the oak wood beneath him. Maybe he was empty, food-wise, at least. But for some reason, Draco didn't like the feeling as much as he used to. On the other hand, Harry was feeling a lot of emotions all at once. Frustration, melancholy and confusion were a few of them. He was frustrated that Draco had just ghosted him for no reason, melancholic because he missed his friend, who was also his crush and confused about everything. Harry even got lost during Defence Against the Dark Arts! He hoped that Draco would tell Hermione the truth. Arithmancy was the last class of the day for Hermione and Draco. Given that Draco and Hermione had paired up for an assignment last time, he had no choice but to sit next to her. Although Hermione hadn't done anything, so would it really be that bad? "Hey Draco, how are you?" Hermione asked with an absence of cheerfulness.  "Fine," Draco mumbled.  Hermione sighed, "Look, Draco, we're all really worried about you, especially Harry. You don't have to talk to him, but can you at least tell me what's going on so he can know?". "Fine. I don't believe that Harry actually cares and has made an atrocious attempt at making me..worse again," Draco said harshly.  "Care to elaborate?" Hermione pressed on.  "He'll know what it means. Now shut up, I'm trying to listen to the teacher," Draco hissed and rested his arms and head on the books in front of him. *** "Shit," Harry swore after Hermione told him what Draco had said.  "What does it even mean?" Ron mumbled while chewing on a drumstick.  "Wouldn't you like to know?" Harry barked rhetorically.  "Calm down, Harry. We're just as worried as you are!" Hermione touched his arm.  Harry shrugged her off, "Bullshit. I'm more worried than both of you combined. I bet you told him, didn't you? You told him that I liked him!" Harry slammed his fists on the table, making plates clatter and heads turn to stare.  "We never told him anything, mate! Look, we get that you have a reason to be especially worried, but it's not our fault!" Ron exclaimed. Harry curled and uncurled his fists.  "You're right, sorry," Harry said quietly.  "Maybe you should send him an owl? Ask him to meet you somewhere?" Hermione suggested. Harry nodded thoughtfully as the three continued their meals in silence. As soon as Harry finished his dinner, he went straight up to the dormitories to write a letter. After furiously scribbling out a just legible note, he rushed up to the owlery to send his letter off. Ever since Hedwig died, he just couldn't bring himself to buy another owl.  He attached the piece of parchment to the brown barn owl and told it where to go. As it flew off, Harry hurried to the Room of Requirement. Draco was writing an essay about Blagdon Blay when he heard tapping on the glass window next to his desk. He turned his head to see an owl baring a letter. Draco unlatched the window, and the owl swooped in and let go of the note on the table. After lingering by the fire, the owl flew back out, Draco closing the window behind it. He unfolded the tattered parchment and began to read: 
Hey Draco, please meet me in the Room of Requirement as soon as you get this letter. I need to tell you something.
 
-HP
 Draco quickly grabbed his cloak and ran out of the common room. 'Wait a second, why the hell am I running to meet him?' Draco thought to himself, although he kept sprinting up to the seventh floor. A small voice nagged at the back of his head. 'Because you miss him'. *** Harry was confident, almost overconfident. He had a plan, and he was going to follow it through. He stared at the ceiling, daring the door to appear. Slowly, the wall showed up, and a nervous Draco timidly opened the door.  Draco closed the door and stared back at Harry as the black-haired boy walked towards him. "What do you want, Pott-" Draco began to speak, but he was cut off by the Gryffindor pulling him by his green and silver tie and smashing their lips together. Draco stood frozen for a second before relaxing and placing his arms on Harry's shoulders. For the first time that day, Draco felt something.

Passion. Pure passion. The red and green from the two boys' robes meshed together, seemingly symbolising their lips. The two boys separated, catching their breath. "Harry," Draco puffed, "what in Merlin's name was that?!".  "Well, I like you, Draco. Also, you are not fat! You are a fucking handsome man, and you are still skinny! Trust me!" Harry replied. He had somehow already caught his breath enough to shout.  "I...I guess I kinda like you too," Draco mumbled, ignoring the lies that he believed Harry was spewing.  "Seriously?!" Harry exclaimed, practically jumping up and down in excitement.  "Calm down, Potter. I thought it was obvious, although you're not exactly quick on the uptake," Draco smirked coyly.  "Hey Draco, we've got a Hogsmeade weekend tomorrow. Do you want to go out, maybe?" Harry asked, scratching the back of his neck nervously.  "I guess that would be enjoyable, yes," Draco said coolly, yet inside, his heart was beating fast, and his stomach was about to explode due to a large number of butterflies in it.  "Thank you, Draco. It's nearly curfew, so we should probably go back to our dorms," Harry said with a slight frown "I suppose we should,". Draco sighed. The door appeared, and the two walked out and stood there awkwardly. "I guess I'll see you tomorrow?" Harry said, his voice high-pitched. Draco pressed Harry against the wall and kissed him lustily.  "See you, Potter,". With that, Draco ran down the steps.  Harry walked to his common room in a blur until Hermione pounced on him, begging for details as Ron reluctantly agreed.  "Well...we made out, and he likes me too, and we're going out tomorrow," Harry said quickly. Hermione squealed breathlessly, and Ron smiled to cover up the fact that he was majorly uncomfortable. "Hermione, what's gotten into you?" Harry exclaimed, "You're never this...this...excited about something like this?".  "Well, Harry. I've known that you've liked Draco for a long time, so it's nice to see you finally doing something about it," Hermione said plainly. "But..I only started liking him...maybe fifth year?" Harry inquired confusedly.  "Well, you're not exactly quick on the uptake," Hermione stated pointedly.  "Yeah, Draco said the same thing," Harry chuckled.  "Um...you're not going..with us, are you?" Ron asked awkwardly.  "Ron!" Hermione yelled angrily.  "It's fine, Hermione! No, we're not," Harry assured.  "Harry, you're not going to Hogsmeade, are you?" Hermione cocked her eyebrows.  "We are. Why?" Harry replied. "Well, are you sure a public date is good for the two of you? I mean, with Draco's father and your publicity. All the attention you'll get from all the other students might not be very...well...ideal," Hermione confessed. "I hadn't thought of that. What should I do?! I don't want to ruin it just as it's begun!" Harry worried, clutching the sides of his hair.  "Calm down, Harry, maybe you could go to the Forbidden Forest? Have a picnic or something?" Hermione suggested, rubbing Harry's back in support.  "Yeah, yeah! God, Hermione, what would I do without you?" Harry piped, enveloping Hermione in a hug.  "Oi, Harry, that's my girlfriend," Ron winked, getting a playful push from Hermione, who, although she tried, could not hide the blush spreading over her face. ***Draco woke up with maybe a bit of morning wood, but who wouldn't if they were about to go on a date with Harry Potter? Draco instinctively ran to the bathroom and stepped on the scale. He was not at a steady weight recently. He was losing and gaining then repeating the cycle. He checked himself out in the bathroom, pinching anything that could have fat on it. All of it did, of course. "Wait, Hogsmeade is full of students!" Draco hissed. He threw on his robes and rushed to the Gryffindor common room. He knocked on the painting and awaited a prefect's reply.  Hermione answered the door. "Draco? What are you doing here?" Hermione asked sleepily.  "I need to talk to Harry about something," Draco said, shivering.  "Draco, you're freezing! Come on inside and lay down by the fireplace. I'll get Harry for you," Hermione said with a sudden burst of energy. Hermione did not want to walk in on anything going on in the boy's dormitory, so she instead sent a Patronus message. She waved her wand and mumbled, and then a silvery otter seeped out from her wand. She gave the otter her message and sent it away.  She sat down, "What the hell was that?" Draco asked in disbelief.  "Oh, Patronus message. Hey, you don't have a Patronus, do you?" Hermione asked.  "No, I don't," Draco replied.  "Well, Harry taught all of us, so maybe he can teach you?" Hermione suggested.  Draco nodded but was soon mesmerised by a messy Harry Potter walking down the stairs. His hair was slightly more ruffled than usual, which was an accomplishment, and his glasses were sliding down his face. Even early in the morning, he still looked perfect. "What? Oh Draco, hey," Harry said, his voice rough.  "I can't go to Hogsmeade. If my father hears about this or-,", Draco started to explain.  He was swiftly cut off by Harry smiling and telling him, "We're not going to Hogsmeade,".  "Well, then where are we going?" Draco questioned confusedly.  "You'll see," Harry winked.  "Oh Draco, I'm so happy you two are finally figuring things out. It's been figurative torture," Hermione said quietly, still half asleep, even though her grammar was impeccable.  "Wait, Hermione knows? Well, she's smart, so I guess it's not too bad," He sighed, Hermione now fully awake and accepting praise.  "Um, well, Ron knows too.." Harry trailed off.  "Weasley?! You're joking! That blood traitor couldn't keep a secret if he tried!" Draco shouted in rage.  "Malfoy!" Hermione and Harry both gasped in sync. Draco's eyes widened.  "Merlin's beard! I'm so sorry I still have this habit when I'm angry. I'll just leave," Draco apologised profusely and turned around to leave.  "No, Draco, it's fine. We understand, but maybe in the future, you could try a little harder?" Hermione assured, surprising Draco.  "I'm sorry, Hermione," Draco said again. "You should be, Malfoy. Flipendo!" As Draco was shot back, Hermione and Harry turned around to see a red-faced Ron with his wand held firmly towards Draco.  "Ron! Don't be foolish!" Hermione shouted.  "I'm not! After all, it's his buddies that killed Fred!" Ron argued. Hermione and Harry were about to correct him when Draco shakily stood up and interrupted them.  "Look, Ronald, I never meant for that to happen, and I know saying that now can't change anything, but I'm really sorry that Rookwood did that. I'm sorry I lost my temper and that I made fun of your family all these years. You don't have to forgive me, that's understandable, but I would like to form some kind of truce," Draco said, voice shaky.  Harry and Hermione looked at Ron. He was shellshocked, and his mouth was wide open. All he could manage was a simple nod and a quick sprint back up the stairs. "Holy cricket Draco, that was...amazing? Surprising? Oddly kind?" Hermione mumbled.  "I guess so. I'll see you three at the Great Hall," Draco said, walking out with his robes flowing behind him, leaving Hermione and Harry utterly transfixed. *** "Ron! Get down here!" Harry shouted angrily, despite Hermione's best efforts to calm him down.  "Harry, his brother died; he can't help it. He's just tired. He didn't mean it!" Hermione said desperately. Ron slowly walked down, with small movement as though he was a chess piece. "Um, hi guys," Ron chuckled nervously. Harry pushed Ron into a wall.  "What the hell were you thinking! Draco's everything to me right now! You had no right!" He screamed.  "I'm sorry, Harry, I just heard him insult my family, and I just lost it. He was a death eater Harry. You have to understand me!" Ron tried to explain. Harry stared at Ron in thought. After what felt like ages to Ron, Harry let go. He sat down with his fists clenched around his messy hair. "Look, mate, I was just a bit angry," Ron said awkwardly.   "It's...it's fine. Let's just go get breakfast," He sighed, dragging himself up the stairs. Ron and Hermione shared one relieved look before going their separate ways to get dressed. Draco had his chin resting on one hand and twirling around his gauntlet with the other. Hermione and Harry strutted over to Draco with a timid Ron trailing after them. "Hey Draco," Harry said as he sat down awkwardly next to him.  "Hi Harry, Hermione...Ron," Draco replied, avoiding Ron's eyes.  "Um, I think Ronald and I will sit at the Gryffindor table this morning," Hermione sighed. The boys nodded.  "So, Potter," Draco smirked after Hermione and Ron had left, "what are we doing today?" Draco raised his eyebrows.  "I told you, you'll find out. Speaking of, you still have a broom, right?" Harry asked.

"Remind me again, Potter. Why do we need our broomsticks?" Draco said grumpily with one hand on his hip.  "I'm going to show you somewhere," Harry rolled his eyes.  Draco sighed, "Well, are we going to go or not?" Draco muttered.  "Come on then, or are you training for the ballet, Malfoy?" Harry snickered and sped away. Draco gasped quietly before jumping on his broom and chasing after him.  Draco quickly caught up to Harry, both laughing when they saw each other. "Give me your hand and close your eyes," Harry demanded, offering his hand.  "Um, what?" Draco stopped and hovered in the air.  Harry rolled his eyes, "I'm going to take you to a place, but I want it to be a surprise. So give me your hand, close your eyes, and I'll lead you down,". Draco sighed and took Harry's hand in his but before closing his eyes, "Oh but for the future, Potter. A Malfoy always leads," He winked.  Harry snorted, "C'mon, just close your eyes you git,".  Although Draco would never admit it, he was a bit frightened to close his eyes on a broom. After all, he was pretty sure it was on Madam Hooch's death list. Thankfully, Harry could tell and strung Draco along slowly. They landed, and Harry helped Draco off his broom. "Alright, Malfoy, open your eyes," Harry said confidently. When Draco opened his eyes, he was standing in a small clearing with a blanket on the ground a small basket.  "What is this?" Draco asked curiously.  "It's a picnic," Harry chuckled. "A picnic?" Draco said, surprised.  "It's when you sit on a blanket on the grass and eat food and talk. Have you never been on one?" Harry asked.  "I know what a picnic is! And no, I've never been on one," Draco admitted, raising his chin proudly to hide his embarrassment.  "Not even with your family? I never did, but my cousin, aunt and uncle would go on the all the time," Harry's voice trailed off.  "Well, my father didn't feel that those sorts of things weren't necessary," Draco said quietly. Harry gave him an empathetic smile and put his arm around Draco's shoulders.  "Well, this will be a first for both of us then," Harry chirped, making Draco grin, no matter how hard he tried to suppress it.  The two sat down. Harry opened the picnic basket, waved his wand and a platter of cheese and crackers flew into his hand, as well as a bottle of cranberry cordial. "Potter, it's amazing that you can actually do that spell. You aren't that advanced in charms," Draco smirked. Harry's face went red, and he scratched the back of his neck.  "Well, Hermione helped me set all this up," Harry said awkwardly. Draco laughed loudly, getting a push from Harry.  "Well, come on then, Potter, I'm not setting up the meal. I am a Malfoy," Draco snickered, turning his nose up. Harry grunted and got two glasses, pouring the cordial into each.  Harry took a large swig from his glass, Draco drank around five milligrams. "Hey, Draco, how come you're so nice this year? And calm?" Harry asked, turning his head towards Draco.  "I don't know. I guess less pressure? And I'm just too tired to be a git," Draco said awkwardly, looking down at his full glass.  "That's understandable," Harry chuckled, "but how come you were so not-Draco this morning? I mean, you apologised and admitted mistakes!". "Well, Potter, I am capable of being reasonable. I used to do it all the time with one of our house-elves," Draco stated blatantly, slightly hurt that what he did that morning was shocking.  "Dobby?" Harry inquired.  "Yeah, I felt kinda bad for how my father treated him. I mean, he probably raised me more than my father did," Draco replied, quieting towards the end of his sentence. Harry slowly took Draco's hand in his and rested his head on Draco's shoulder. Still looking down, Draco managed a small smile.  *** When the two met Hermione and Ron back at the castle, they were greeted with pitiful looks. "What's wrong?" Harry asked.  "Well, Professor McGonagall told us to give this to you, Draco," Hermione said uncomfortably, handing Draco a letter that appeared to be a Howler. "Oh no, I didn't think they'd actually do it," Draco gulped.  "Do what?" Harry said, his fists curling.  "I heard a couple of kids in my common room talking about telling my father about you guys," Draco replied, hands shaking and eyes full of fear.  "Maybe, maybe it's your mother? She maybe wanted to tell you off for something else? We know your mother is nice," Harry suggested, fists still clenched and eyes darting around, looking for guilty Slytherins.  "Well, there's only one way to find out, mate. Let's just hope it's not as bad as mine," Ron chuckled uncomfortably.  Draco sighed, "I'd rather open it in the Room of Requirement?". "We better hurry then; it'll open by itself soon," Hermione said, and they all began sprinting up to the seventh floor, praying that the Vanishing Stairs were on their side. When they had eventually opened the room, the letter exploded. "DRACO LUCIUS MALFOY! WHAT IS THIS FILTH THAT I'VE HEARD ABOUT YOU TALKING TO POTTER, WEASLEY AND THAT MUDBLOOD! THIS IS DESPICABLE, AND IF THIS CONTINUES, DO NOT BOTHER COMING HOME!" The letter spewed. Before shredding itself up, another note fell out. Draco opened the written letter.  "What does it say?" Harry prodded. "It reads: Do not listen to your father, Draco. Although, it may be best for your safety if you go somewhere else. I've sent an owl to Miss Weasley, and she had confirmed that it would be okay. But, if you disrespect them at all, you are coming straight home." Draco read, eyes staring wide at Ron to see how he would take this.  "Um, well, if my mum says it's okay, then I guess so?" Ron scratched the back of his neck.  "Thank you so much, Ronald," Draco said, extending his hand.  "Um, no problem, mate," Ron said, shaking Draco's hand. "You're coming too, right Harry?" Ron asked.  "Sorry, mate. I promised Kreacher I'd spend Christmas with him. I'll be visiting, though, on Christmas day. Would it be okay if Kreacher came with me? Goes crazy on Christmas," Harry apologised. Hermione and Draco shared a look.  "Well, Harry, why don't you and Draco stay at Sirius' together? Kreacher would probably be honoured to have a Malfoy in his house," Hermione piped up, "If you're okay with that?". "I would love to," Draco said, blushing and looking down at the ground.  "Brilliant! Just try not to agree about Kreacher's blood purity views. I've worked hard to keep him under wraps," Harry laughed, pulling Draco in for a kiss. Hermione and Ron sat there awkwardly until Hermione coughed to get their attention.  "Merlin's Beard! I'm so sorry, that was such an uncivilised thing to do!" Draco yelled.  "Uncivilised? Draco, it's fine to do that. Just keep it short, you know?" Hermione assured him.  "Oh, you can talk!" Harry cackled. Hermione blushed, and Ron punched him in the arm.  "You're the one who was making out with my sister!" Ron shouted. They all went quiet and looked at Draco.  He started chuckling, then laughing uncontrollably. "He's not wrong, Potter!".  The trio stared at this snorting boy who barely smiled and couldn't help laughing too.

"It's kind of weird that your dad sent you that so early, isn't it? I mean, it's not even October yet," Harry said with realisation in his voice.  "No. It's a typical Malfoy tactic. You get the pain to start as early as you can," Draco replied, shrugging his shoulders.  "That's kind of...horrible. Wanting to cause pain against your own son," Hermione said quietly. "Well, I guess so," Draco agreed. "Harry, are you okay, mate?" Ron asked. Draco and Hermione turned their heads to look at Harry, who had stopped behind the group, looking down at the ground and shaking. "Harry? Are you okay?" Hermione asked as Draco ran past her to hold Harry. "Harry, are you okay? C'mon, you tell me," Draco said quietly.  "O-Octo-to," Harry stuttered.  "October? Yeah, it's in two days," Draco guessed, quirking his eyebrows.  "P-Parents...V-Volder..." Harry whimpered again, blinking back tears.  "Oh, Harry, it's going to be okay. We'll all be right here with you," Draco said, remembering what else was talked about on October 31st.  "C-Cold," Harry said. "Okay, we're going to take you to the common room, alright?" Draco said, picking Harry up bridal style and following Hermione and Ron to the common room.  They reached the painting and stepped through. Draco rushed Harry to the couch closest to the fireplace. "It's getting late. I should probably go. Please take care of him, though?" Draco said when Harry had stopped shivering, "And you should probably get to bed,".  Draco walked off while Ron and Hermione began to help Harry up the stairs to the dorm. Thankfully, Harry fell asleep as soon as his head hit the pillow. Draco, however, could not sleep. His mind flickered between remembering Harry during the day to how Harry was that night.  Suddenly, he heard his name being called. He rushed out of bed and slipped out of the Slytherin dorms. Hermione stood there. "Come on, Draco! You need to come quickly!" She shouted, grabbing Draco by the arm and pulling him to a running pace. Harry was leaning back and forth on his bed, crying and whimpering. Every attempt of Ron trying to touch him was greeted with screaming. "Harry! Please! Hermione went down to get Malfoy. Is he going to calm you down?" Ron begged.  "D-Draco?" Harry said quietly. Ron nodded.  As if by magic, Draco arrived straight after that fretful nod. He swept over to Harry and pulled him into his arms. When Harry had stopped crying, he began to talk again. "Y-You're gonna sleep here, with me, right?". "I...of course, Potter," Draco said, smiling at the raven-haired boy dearly. Hermione slowly made her way out of the boys' dorm as Ron walked even slower to his bed. Harry sat there, not knowing what to do. Draco rolled his eyes and pushed Harry softly so that he was lying down. Pulling the cover over them, Draco assumed the position of the big spoon, his arm wrapped around Harry's waist and pulling him close. Harry was still shaking. The Slytherin kissed the top of the boy's head and gently ran his fingers through his hair. Harry began to calm, and eventually, Draco could make out his faint snores.  The feeling of being this close to the person he had always wanted to be close to was enough to send Draco to sleep not long after. ***  Fortunately, Draco woke up before the entire Gryffindor house and made it seem like he had fallen asleep in the common room rather than Harry Potter's bed.  As soon as he had stepped on the first step down, he heard screaming that sounded a lot like it was coming from a certain boy. Draco cautiously opened the door, and instead of seeing Harry on his bed, he saw a lump covered in sheets. Draco walked over and slowly slid off the covers. Under it sat a very scared Gryffindor. Draco quickly enveloped Harry into his arms and held him. "Where'd you g-go?" Harry squeaked.  "I only went to the common room," Draco said softly, caressing Harry's tear-stained cheek. Harry nodded and pulling Draco under the covers into a cuddle. Draco sighed lovingly and closed his eyes again. But, Harry had officially woken up and was unable to go back to sleep. "I'm cold. Do you want to go to the common room in front of the fire?" Draco asked gently. Harry nodded, and Draco helped him walk, with the covers still over him.  They managed to make it to the couch in front of the fire. Harry lay his head on Draco's stomach and burrowed under the blankets. Draco chuckled and played with Harry's hair. Hermione, being Hermione, was awake soon after. "How did he sleep?" She yawned.  "All night through," Draco smiled.  "That's good then," Hermione smiled back. She sat in the armchair next to them and opened a book, obviously.  "New Theory of Numerology? I read that. It was interesting, but I didn't totally agree with the whole thing," Draco said, noticing the book cover.  "Oh, this is my fifth time reading it. You're right; it is interesting but not entirely sensible," Hermione agreed. Draco nodded.  "It's Sunday, guys; shut up about education," Harry groaned.  "Hey! Scar-head is back!" Draco teased. Harry grunted, and his face popped out from under the covers. "Potter, could you sit up for a second?" Draco asked. Harry complied, although he was very suspicious. Draco slipped out his wand and waved it wordlessly. The three waited. Nothing happened. "Merlin's fucking beard Harry! I used magic, and your hair didn't even tidy at all!" Draco shouted, his ears red.  "Potter hair has forces beyond magic," Harry said confidently, smirking in the way Draco hated but loved at the same time. "Hey guys," An unknown voice said. They all turned around and were shocked to see Ron Weasley up this early.  "Ron? What are you doing awake this early?" Hermione exclaimed. "I heard Draco shout, had to see what pissed him off," Ron laughed.  "If you must know, Harry's hair didn't tidy even after I used magic!" Draco exasperated and rolled his eyes.  "Oh, Hermione could've told you that before. She's tried many, many times," Ron replied. Draco turned back in a huff and crossed his arms.  "I'm starving. Let's go," Ron said.  "Well, maybe get dressed first?" Hermione said, raising her eyebrow. Ron rolled his eyes and turned back towards his dorm. "I guess we'll all do that then," Hermione suggested, also walking to her dorm.  "But I can't be seen in bed robes around the castle!" Draco stressed.  "Just use my invisibility cloak," Harry said, taking Draco's hand lazily and pulling him up the stairs. They reached the dorm, and Harry threw the cloak at Draco. "See you in the hall, unless you want a show?" Harry winked. Draco wrinkled his nose and walked away briskly, primarily to hide the blush creeping up his face. *** Using that cloak was really, really weird to Draco. He was not used to walking past people without being noticed, but for that very reason, he enjoyed it. Everyone saw him for the wrong reasons anyway. When Draco was getting dressed, he felt his pants struggle to go above his hipbones. As he put his shirt on, he felt his collarbones almost cutting out of his skin, and when buttoning the last button, his hand grazed his sharp jawline. He knew he wasn't fatter. Mind you, he definitely thought he was fat, just not fatter than usual.  Draco walked into the dining room with less of a confident demeanour. Delicious food was everywhere. But, once he saw Harry's face, his mind saw flashes of this smiling boy breaking down in his arms. He had to eat at least a couple of grapes. He had to be the strong one. It didn't matter if Draco was scared or unhappy about it. All that mattered was Harry's happiness.  So when he sat down and was greeted with smiles from everyone (even Ron!), he ate. He thought he looked fine, but in his mind, that was farther from the truth. Through breakfast, everyone seemed happy except the boy with glasses. From this morning, Draco thought he'd seem a bit better. 'Maybe he thinks I'm going to get fat from eating!' He thought, but when he put down his piece of toast, but then Harry looked confused. Draco looked back at him, just as confused. Hermione and Ron were now confused, watching these two puzzled boys stare at each other. Harry abruptly stood up and pulled Draco out of the hall by his arm. "What's going on?" Draco asked. "I just want to know if you're eating for the wrong reasons. Suppose you're eating because you want me to be happy after last night, don't. I'd rather you eat because you're trying to recover. Because I am here to help you with that," Harry confronted. Draco pulled out the invisibility cloak from within his robe, "Hey, I forgot to give you this," He said as he covered Harry and himself under it.  "What are you do-" Harry was cut off by Draco passionately kissing his lips.

Draco drew apart, stepped out from under the cloak and walked back into the hall, leaving Harry to stand with his eyes open wide. Draco sat back down with Hermione and Ron with a smirk on his face. "Malfoy, what have you done?" Ron asked suspiciously.  "Look at him walking over here and guess," Draco replied, biting his lip and nodding his head off towards the Great Hall entrance. Ron and Hermione turned to look and saw Harry walking towards them clumsily with a large blush and a dizzy smile on his face. Ron's ears went red as he hastily looked back down at his plate, while Hermione was wearing an all-knowing smirk on her face. "Hey, uh, hey guys," Harry greeted them sloppily.  "Oh, hello Harry, you two have a good talk?" Hermione sneered.  "Um, yeah," Harry said, gulping after the statement. Ron kept on eating, avoiding everyone's eyes. After breakfast, Harry had finally regained some sense and was able to ask Draco out again. "Hey Draco, wanna go out today?" Harry asked.  "Sure, where?" Draco replied after sipping his water and setting his glass down.  "Well...I was thinking Hogsmeade?" Harry shifted awkwardly in his seat.  "Harry, you know we can't do that," Draco whispered.  "Draco, your father already knows we're friends. Your mother has sent me a letter telling me not to break your heart because you told her already. We don't have to take other people's shit," Harry said quietly.  "I just...I just can't, okay?" Draco said, his voice trembling. Harry opened his mouth, but before he could speak, Hermione piped up. "Just let me cast muffliato first, okay? And Harry, he just snogged you, so be nice," Hermione waved her wand and looked at the boys expectantly.  "Why not Draco?" Harry said in a softer voice.  "I'm just not ready, okay? Some Slytherins can be very judgemental. It's like that in every house, but I just don't need to deal with that right now. My father just fucking told me not to come home for Christmas for Merlin's sake!" Draco said, tears gathering in his eyes.  "Draco, I'm sorry. We can wait until you're ready, that's fine. You can tell me anything, though. You know that, right?" Harry said gently. Draco sighed and nodded.  "Guys, come on. I'm trying to eat here, not be an emotional wreck," Ron said with his mouth stuffed with food. There was a brief moment of silence before they all burst out laughing. *** Draco and Harry were walking around the castle after breakfast had finished.  "Hey, Harry, I thought maybe we could go to Hogsmeade? But keep the affection down?" Draco said, looking down at the ground.  "Really, Draco? I'd love to! And you know we could always get a private booth at Madam Pudifoots. They have invisibility charms!" Harry exclaimed.  "They do?" Draco said surprisedly.  "Haven't you ever been to Madam Pudifoots with someone?" Harry asked curiously.  "I've never dated anyone.." Draco admitted, embarrassed. Harry nodded carelessly, to Draco's surprise. "Um, so..could you come with me for a sec? Tell me what to wear and such," Harry asked shyly.  "Well, I'm already dressed, so I suppose I could offer some guidance," Draco replied, adjusting the collar of his shirt. Harry rolled his eyes at Draco's overly-sophisticated wording and grabbed his hand, pulling him up to the Gryffindor dormitory. The two walked into the boys' bedroom that conveniently had nobody else occupying it at the time. Harry lead Draco over to his wardrobe and let Draco work his magic.  Draco picked out a light blue shirt, black slacks and a leather jacket. He lay them on Harry's bed and began to walk towards the exit. "Where are you going?" Harry asked, grabbing Draco's shoulder gently.  "To the common room?" Draco replied, very confused.  "No, stay," Harry said, a slight hint of a smirk in his smile.  "Um..alright," Draco said, sitting down on a random bed. Harry winked before turning around and starting to undress. As much as Draco tried to look away, he couldn't help but stare at Harry's back, his muscles moving with every movement his arms made. Soon enough, Harry had finished and turned around to Draco's red face.  "I had some doubt, Draco, but you're definitely not straight," Harry chuckled. Draco snapped out of his trance and pushed Harry away. Harry laughed,  "C'mon, let's go; Hermione and Ron want to meet us at Tomes and Scrolls,". Draco's eyes lit up at the mention of the bookstore as he stood up and began walking out of the room. Harry shook his head and hurried after him. *** The two walked into Tomes and Scrolls; their hands desperately close yet not touching. Hermione was marvelling at the newest, environmentally safe parchment, Ron watching her with a loving smile. Harry smiled, as did Draco. He hated to admit it, but Ron and Hermione were adorable together.  Hermione looked up, "Oh! Hello Harry, Malfoy," She smiled widely. Ron snapped out of his trance and gave the two smirking boys a sheepish grin. "Malfoy, come look at this quill!" Hermione said, motioning for him to follow her. Draco's face lit up as he ran after her. Ron and Harry rolled their eyes and went over to the test parchment, writing silly things and drawing crude pictures. Hermione and Draco came back with slightly annoyed faces. "Could you two be any more immature?" Hermione questioned, raising her eyebrow.  "Wanna find out?" Ron answered back.  "Ugh, Merlin's Beard," Draco said, lightly smacking his forehead.  "Well, Ron and I promised to meet Parvati and Lavender at The Hog's Head, so we best be off," Hermione said, grabbing Ron's hand.  As they walked off, Ron surprisingly shouted, "Have fun, you two!". Harry and Draco looked at each other and blushed before walking out of the store to Madam Pudifoots. The two sat down at their reserved booth and looked down at the table awkwardly. "It'd be fantastic if Lupin and Black were here to offer us advice on this whole dating thing," Draco piped up.  "Huh? What do you mean?" Harry asked confusedly.  "You don't know?" Draco frowned, "Snape said..." He trailed off.  Harry shrugged, "What do you want? I'll go order it,". Draco looked down at the menu and gasped in horror. There was nothing but sugary treats that were at least eight hundred calories each. "I..I.." Draco stared down at the menu, tears of frustration threatening to seep out.  "Draco, it's okay," Harry leaned forward and placed his hand over Draco's, "They have a fruit bowl out front. I'll just get you an apple, alright? You can just order some tea at the very least," Harry said comfortingly. Draco relaxed slightly and nodded.  He gulped, "I'll just have an English Breakfast, skim milk,". Harry nodded with a small smile and stood up to order. "Oh, Harry?" Draco called out.  Harry turned around, "Yeah?".  "Thank you," Draco said nervously. Harry smiled and walked away. *** Despite the heartbreaking moment where Harry had to watch Draco struggle to simply order food, their date went smoothly. Draco wasn't wholly trusting of the invisibility charms but held Harry's hand nonetheless. It was almost time for them to go back to Hogwarts when Draco had moved over to Harry's side of the booth and leant his head on Harry's shoulder.  The two walked back through Hogsmeade with Ron and Hermione, their hands feeling cold and empty. Though they were happy for Hermione and Ron, they could not help but envy the publicity of their relationship. Although Draco and Harry weren't really in a relationship, were they? The rest of the four students' day was uneventful. Full of banter but uneventful. Well, except for after dinner. The four had gone up to the Room of Requirement, and one thing led to another until soon; three of them were showing off their patronuses. Draco watched in awe as Ron's terrier chased after Hermione's otter. Harry's stag watched over them. Although he was magnificent, he was more concerned about supervising the other two silvery entities.  "What do you think yours would be, Malfoy? A ferret?" Ron laughed, and Draco rolled his eyes.  "When I have a happy enough memory, we'll find out," Draco smirked. The others chuckled uncomfortably.  "We're still getting used to your type of um, humour," Hermione said nervously. Draco shrugged.  "Blimey! Look at the time!" Ron shouted suddenly. It was almost curfew. The four of them ran out the door and sprinted down the stairs. Draco gave one small kiss to Harry at the entrance of the Gryffindor common room before continuing to run down the stairs, of course, settling for a power walk eventually, as his joints hurt too much to exhaust them to that extent. Harry was lying in bed, wide awake. "It's going to take us a long time to go public, but..we shouldn't have to wait too long to be a couple at all!". After Harry's epiphany, he quickly jumped out of bed, grabbed his invisibility cloak and headed out the door. Meanwhile, Draco's thoughts were swimming around his mind. His father's words were clashing with Harry's. Was he willing to risk it? Draco was startled at the sudden creak of his bedroom door. "Wh-who's there?" Draco stammered, getting up from his bed and clutching his wand tight. The door swung open, but there was no one there.  "Harry! For fuck's sake!" Draco yelled breathlessly as Harry appeared from under his cloak.  "I'm sorry, Draco, but it's important," Harry said.  "Well, what is it?" Draco inquired, rolling his eyes. Harry walked closer to Draco. "I was wondering if you would do me the honour of being my boyfriend?".

"Harry! For fuck's sake!" Draco yelled breathlessly as Harry appeared from under his cloak.  
"I'm sorry, Draco, but it's important," Harry said. 
 
"Well, what is it?" Draco inquired, rolling his eyes. Harry walked closer to Draco.
 
"I was wondering if you would do me the honour of being my boyfriend?".
 Draco stared at Harry, his mouth open wide. Harry's confidence quickly simmered down when he saw Draco's reaction. "I mean, if you don't want to, that's totally fine. I would understand if you.." Harry's rambling was interrupted when Draco hugged Harry tightly.  "Of course I would," Draco said, pulling back and smiling. Harry grinned and kissed Draco on the cheek before putting his cloak back on. "Do you have to leave?" Draco asked.  "No, if you want me to, I can stay," The voice of an unseeable Harry spoke back. Harry came back into vision once again and grabbed Draco's hand in his. "Hey, how come you have a room to yourself?" Harry asked curiously.  "Well..they think I'm a danger," Draco replied quietly.  "Who's they?" Harry said, sounding a lot more serious.  "The parents of all the other boys, of course. Professor McGonagall got thousands of letters from their mothers saying that if I were to come back, I could not be around their boys," Draco said coolly, "Of course, Professor McGonagall has a mindset similar to Dumbledore's. Still, out of concern for my safety, I got my own room,". "Draco, how have things been since then, the war, I mean," Harry said softly.  Draco shuffled and looked at the floor. "Even worse than you'd think..".  "Tell me, Draco," Harry said, taking Draco to sit down on the bed.  "Getting spat on everywhere you go, Ministry punishments, still treated terribly by your father, unable to show yourself in public. I live in fear of everyone every day, Harry! I-I.." Draco started to sob. Harry threw his arms around the frail boy and held him tightly.  "You'll be okay Draco, I'm here, and I will never let anyone hurt you," Harry said softly. "Can you stay with me tonight?" Draco blurted out.  "I..sure," Harry smiled. Draco rolled over to one side of the bed and curled up into a ball. Harry sighed lovingly and got into the bed next to him, pulling the covers up over them. Harry pulled Draco closer to him. "C'mon Draco; you can't stay curled up like that forever," Harry cooed. Draco lay still for a moment before slowly stretching out his body. Harry draped his arm around Draco's waist and rested his head above Draco's. With the warmth provided by Harry and the contentedness they both felt, they quickly fell asleep. *** Harry awoke to an empty bed; it took him a second to register where he was before he remembered where he was and went to look for Draco. He needn't have looked far. Draco was right next to the bed, doing push-ups. Or at least that's what it looked like. Due to the apparent lack of muscle, Draco seemed only to be shifting up and down. "Draco, what are you doing?" Harry asked, which startled Draco, who fell to the floor.  "Um, push-ups?" Draco said confusedly.  "Baby, you can barely lift yourself. You don't have enough energy," Harry said gently.  Draco blushed."What do you mean? I'm fine!" He replied coolly, lifting himself back up off the floor with great struggle.  Harry rolled his eyes, "You're not doing that anymore. You've got to eat before you can even think about exercising". Harry got off the bed, picked Draco up in his arms and placed him back on the bed. "I need to go and get changed, okay? I'll see you at breakfast," Harry threw on his invisibility cloak and hurried out the door.  Harry was greeted with two very different perspectives. Harry had only just come out of the boys' dorm with his robes on when he was welcomed with Ron's uncomfortable looking face. "So, I noticed you didn't sleep here last night. I checked the map and.." In Ron's hands was a blank folded piece of old parchment, but of course, Harry knew what it was. Before Harry could reply, he was confronted with Hermione's smug expression that she seemed to be wearing a lot these days.  "What were you two up to last night?" Hermione asked suggestively.  "If you must know," Harry began nervously, "I went down to Draco to ask him to, um, be my boyfriend and-" He was interrupted by Hermione's outburst,  "Did he say yes?!". Harry sighed and nodded, gaining a very excited little jump from the unusually insensible girl.  "Anyway, we had a bit of an emotional chat, and I stayed the night. Nothing happened. We just..cuddled," Harry said as a deep red blush creeped up his face.  "Well, that's nice. Shall we go down to breakfast then?" Hermione said, straightening out her slightly messy shirt. The two boys nodded and followed her outside of the portrait door.  "Um, good going, mate, I guess," Ron said awkwardly, timidly holding his hand out for a high five. Harry chuckled and slapped Ron's hand lightly. They made it to the Great Hall where Draco was already sitting at the end of the Slytherin table, nothing on his plate. Harry sat down next to him. "What are we having today?" He said enthusiastically. Draco gave him a death stare, but Harry was not deterred.  "C'mon, maybe an orange? Switch it up from apples, hm?" Harry said. He took an orange from the ornate golden bowl and cut it into fourths. He slid them onto Draco's plate. Draco sighed and picked up a slice. "Oh, and some milk," Harry said as he passed his cup to Draco. The pale boy sighed and took a sip of milk. Harry smiled approvingly.  "You know, I may be like this, but at least I have manners," Draco said, smirking at Ron, who was gulping down bites of toast drowned by orange juice.  "Piss off, Malfoy," He grunted.  "Ron! That's disgusting!" Hermione yelled as bits of food flew out of his mouth onto her plate. Harry and Draco laughed at the two as Ron tried to apologise but still managed to spit food everywhere. "Hey, what classes do we have today?" Harry asked as he turned to Draco.  "How should I know?" Draco scoffed. Harry rolled his eyes and drew out his schedule from inside his robes.  "Hey, we have double Potions and double Flying together!" Harry said excitedly. Draco smiled. "Oh, Draco and I have Arithmancy together as well!" Hermione said, without needing to look at her schedule, of course.  "Yeah, Ron and I have Ghoul Studies together," Harry said as he looked through the schedule. "Wow, you're so entertaining, Potter," Draco said sarcastically, giving Harry a slow clap.  "You want entertainment, Malfoy? Wait until you and I get into a broom cupboard," Harry recounted, wiggling his eyebrows. Draco quickly looked down at his plate, his face going beet red as Ron coughed on a piece of bacon. Hermione snickered as Harry patted Draco on the shoulder. "Hey, it's okay. We can always go somewhere nicer," He said and winked.  "Shut up, Harry! There are people everywhere!" Draco hissed, trying very hard to hide his sheepish smile.  "Oh yeah, shit. I forgot," Harry realised. The rest of them laughed at Harry's dumbfounded expression.  "I'll see you guys later. I'm going to get my books," Hermione proclaimed as she stood up, giving Ron a peck on the cheek before she left.  "I oughta do that too," Draco said, standing up and looking at Harry awkwardly, sincerely wishing he could also show affection in public. Draco subtly pressed his fingers to his lips and quickly touched Harry's cheek before speeding away.  As he left, he could hear Ron laughing. Draco stole a quick glance at Harry, who was giving Ron a death stare as he blushed profusely.

Chapter Text
Harry and Ron walked into the Potions classroom to see Draco and Hermione talking, books already out, cauldrons ready, and ingredients ready.  "Nerds," Ron snickered as he neared them.  "Redhead," Draco replied quickly. The top of Ron's ears went red as he sat down next to Hermione.  "Suppose I'll also get a partner I can cheat off of," Harry smirked. Draco rolled his eyes. "Trust me; Granger is no match for me. I will teach you and teach you only," He said, paying attention to the front of the classroom where Slughorn had just walked in. "This class, we will be revising amortentia and perfecting the potion. Make sure you fill in every detail, including the smells," Slughorn announced, his gaze seeming to stay in Draco and Harry for longer than a second. Draco shuffled in his seat as the class resumed their chatter.  "Hey, I remember a bit about how you did this potion. Maybe I can help this time!" Harry piped up.  "You've done no studying. How do you remember?" Draco said sceptically.  "Well, I was watching you the whole time," Harry admitted sheepishly. Draco smiled at Harry.  "I still can't let you do the whole thing on your own. I'd like to keep this classroom intact," Draco winked. This time after finishing the potion, Harry and Draco were able to admit what they smelt truthfully. "Are the smells meant to change?" Harry asked.  "Yeah, that means that the potion is adaptable and well brewed," Draco said.  "Okay, good. Well, I smell a broomstick handle, ink and saltwater," Harry said, slightly confused by the last one. Draco cocked his eyebrows before saying  "Hm, I smell tea, fresh grass and fire,". They both looked at each other as if they would give reasons before they wrote it down and handed in their report to Slughorn.  "Ah, the smells changed since last time, did they? I don't know if you're lying, but I hope you're not. It seems as though you two may have brewed a perfect potion. Thinking about some special ladies, hm?" Slughorn smiled.  "Uh, something like that," Harry said awkwardly as Draco covered his mouth with his hand, trying not to laugh.  Draco and Harry collected their things and walked out of the classroom. As soon as the door shut behind them, they burst out laughing. "Oh, Slughorn," Draco wheezed.  "Off to flying now, I suppose?" Harry proposed. Draco nodded.  "I'll see you on the pitch," Harry said as he walked off. Draco smiled after him, but when he turned around, he was met with two Slytherin boys, sixth years by the look of them.  "Um, hello?" Draco said as they blocked him from walking away.  "Mingling, are we?" One of them smirked.  "Look, you know where house rivalry got us before, leave it, would you?" Draco sighed.  "Oh, we don't care about that," The other one said.  "Then what's the problem?" Draco reiterated.  "Well, dating a Gryffindor girl would be fine, but a boy? We can't accept that Malfoy," He said.  "Excuse me? Harry and I are not dating. Now piss off, why don't you?" Draco said, straightening his posture. He was taller than the other two but much weaker. "And if we don't? What's your father gonna do this time?" One of them said coyly. Draco gulped and stepped back, but the two boys stepped towards him.  "What are you doing?" Draco asked, his voice quivering slightly.  "We just want to see if your bones are as fragile as they look," The boy smiled maliciously.  "Hey," A voice said behind Draco. He turned around. It was Harry.  "What do you want?" One of the boys grunted.  "For you to leave him alone," Harry said politely.  "Hm...no," One of them replied. "What are your names?" Harry asked.  "I'm Kevin, this is Tyler," He said, pointing at his friend.  "Okay, Kevin and Tyler, McGonagall would love to meet you. Should I tell her you two were being dickheads?" Harry asked. Kevin grunted and looked at Tyler. He rolled his eyes, and the two walked away. "Are you okay? Did they hurt you?" Harry asked Draco as he walked swiftly towards him.  "No. But people are catching on, Harry," Draco said worriedly.  Harry sighed, "Innocent until proven guilty. I'll protect you Draco,".  He blushed, "Thanks, I should probably go get changed," Draco said. Harry nodded and let him walk away.  *** "Are you sure you're up to it?" Harry asked Draco as the two were waiting with Ron for Professor Hooch. Draco nodded, and Harry sighed.  "I'm sure he'll be fine, mate," Ron said, putting his hand on Harry's shoulder. Madam Hooch came onto the field soon and appointed people to their positions. Everyone was up in the air, except for Draco.  "Um, excuse me, Professor, but you haven't given me a position," Draco said, holding his hand up.  "Oh! Right. The headmistress wishes to speak with you," She replied. Draco sighed, waved goodbye to Ron and Harry and walked away towards the castle.  He walked to the entrance and said "Ragdoll,". The golden griffin turned to reveal the stairs, and Draco walked up to them. He walked through the door into what used to be Dumbledore's office but now belonged to McGonagall. "Ah Draco, please sit down," She said as Draco stepped over the threshold.  "Why is it you wanted to see me, Headmistress?" Draco asked, sitting down on one of the emerald armchairs.  "Well, it has come to my attention that you have not put down your confirmation for staying here at Hogwarts over the holidays," She replied.  "Oh well, Harry Potter has invited me to stay with him," Draco said.  "Oh, I see. You two seem to be spending a lot of time together. I've had a couple of Gryffindor students asking me if it's allowed for students from other houses to spend the night in their dormitory. Of course, it is permitted as long as it isn't a daily predicament. But I have heard some interesting things," McGonagall said, cocking her eyebrow.  "O-Oh," Draco avoided Mcgonagall's gaze.  "You may go back to your class," She sighed.  "Thank you, Headmistress," Draco said, exiting her office. Does everyone know? Draco thought as he walked back towards the field. Did Weasley and Granger blab? Draco's judgement got the best of him, and he walked back to his dorm instead.  *** "Where's Draco?" Hermione asked as Ron and Draco sat down for lunch.  "I don't know. He left to see McGonagall, and we haven't seen him since," Harry replied.  "Maybe the meeting is running a bit long; I'm sure he'll be at Arithmancy," Hermione said, returning to her book.  "Yeah, Hermione's right," Ron said through mouthfuls of a ham sandwich. Harry sighed and went to eat when Hermione closed her book loudly.  "He's over there. Why didn't he sit with us?" Hermione said. Harry and Ron turned around, and sure enough, Draco was sitting at the Slytherin table, not eating. Harry walked over.  "Hey Draco, we were wondering where you were," Harry said brightly.  "We need to talk, right now. All of us," Draco said, jerking his head in the direction of the corridor. Harry nodded and waved over Ron and Hermione as Draco walked off.  "What is it Draco," Hermione asked.  "Did either of you two tell anyone about...you know," Draco questioned.  "What? Of course not," Hermione replied. Draco sighed, "Everyone seems to understand what's going on,".  "Well, no offence, but you two haven't been the most subtle," Ron admitted.  "Ron's right," Harry said.  "Then what do we do?" Draco hissed.  "Let rumour be rumours, or..." Harry trailed off. "Or what?" Draco asked.  "Or not hide it," Harry said quietly. Draco stayed silent for a few seconds before sighing.  "I need to talk to my mother," He stated.  "Of course, maybe we should both talk to her. We could send her an owl and ask her to come down to the school?" Harry suggested.  Draco nodded, "Let's do that,". Harry clasped Draco's hands in his own, "It's going to be okay,".

Draco and Harry stood nervously at the Hogwarts entrance. "Draco, it's going to be okay," Harry said, holding Draco's shaking hands. Draco's breath turned to mist in the cold air, but at least Harry could tell that his breathing was slowing down.  "Draco!" The two turned around to see Narcissa smiling, with her arms stretched out wide.  "Mother!" Draco exclaimed, running over and hugging her. Harry walked over and held out his hand to shake. Narcissa shook it and gave Harry a knowing look. The three began walking back to the castle, Draco and Narcissa catching up and Harry trying his best not to mess anything up. They got into the courtyard and sat down. "So, Mother, Harry and I invited you here because we needed to talk to you about something," Draco said. Narcissa nodded, and Draco took a deep breath. "So, people have kind of been catching onto Harry, and I's situation. Just this morning, these two boys, Kevin and Tyler, confronted me about it until Harry stepped in. Even Professor McGonagall is catching on! We were thinking of just..." Draco explained, trailing off.  "Ending it?" Narcissa said.  "Wh-What? No!" Draco said, taken aback.  "What Draco is trying to say, Mrs Malfoy is that we were thinking of letting it go public, but we thought it ought to be brought up to you first," Harry sighed.  "Oh, well, the only real trouble is that...I don't know how Lucius would take it. You could try to hide it from him, but those Slytherin boys might send him another letter," Narcissa said thoughtfully.  "That's exactly what I was thinking," Draco exasperated.  "But this is something you want to do, Draco? Not just to please Potter?" Narcissa asked. Draco looked up at her and nodded. Narcissa hesitated, "Then you should do it. Don't let your father tell you how to live your life again," Narcissa stated. Draco threw his arms around his mother. Harry smiled at them. You were always able to tell that Draco and Narcissa had a strong bond, much better than the one between Draco and Lucius. Or between Draco and anyone, for that matter. "I need to get back to the manor, see if he takes it better from me than a couple of random children," Narcissa said, breaking the hug.  "Thank you, Mother," Draco said, giving her another quick hug.  "From both of us, Mrs Malfoy," Harry said, holding out his hand again. Narcissa hugged him briefly instead.  "Take good care of my Draco, Harry Potter," Narcissa demanded quietly.  "You have my word," Harry complied. Narcissa smiled at the two boys before walking away.  It was honestly about time she saw those two together. *** "Are you ready, Draco?" Harry asked as the two boys stood outside the main entrance. Draco sighed and nodded. Harry took his hand and squeezed it before opening the doors and walking through. It was almost lunchtime, so there was an unsurprisingly large amount of students loitering in the corridor. Whenever those large front doors open, you are bound to be glanced at. But if you happened to be Draco Malfoy and Harry Potter holding hands, people would be bound to take a double-take. Draco did his best to focus on where he was going, but that was proving to be quite tricky. "Harry! Harry! I just wanted to say on behalf of Gryffindor that we support you!" A boy with mousey brown hair ran up eagerly, "You too, Malfoy," He said, acknowledging Draco.  "Thank you, Dennis," Harry smiled. The boy grinned back and ran off to join a brown-haired Hufflepuff whom Draco knew as Rose Zeller. A few other Gryffindors, Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs nodded warmly in Draco and Harry's direction. There were no Slytherins to be seen; most of them were either early in the Great Hall or planning to be fashionably late to lunch. Hermione and Ron appeared out of seemingly nowhere. "Well, I guess we don't have to ask," Ron chuckled and scratched the back of his neck.  "Congratulations, you two!" Hermione exclaimed, pulling Draco and Harry in for a quick embrace.  "Thank you, Hermione, Ronald," Draco said, smiling.  "Shall we?" Harry alluded to the hall. The other three nodded, and they walked in.  Now, it was time to see what the Slytherins thought. The general reaction seemed to be friendly and accepting, except for a couple. Two of them noticeably being Kevin and Tyler. The four sat down at the front of the Gryffindor table. A few teachers had joined with the students, sitting up at the table. Soon, Professor McGonagall tapped her glass with a spoon, and the food appeared.  As the four were tucking into lunch, a group of Slytherins and one Hufflepuff came up to them. Kevin and Tyler were not present this time, although they watched from the table with smirks on their faces. "Hello, Gayco. Wait until your father hears about this one," A boy said.  "Names please?" Hermione asked, subtly adjusting her tie.  The boy sighed, "I'm Derek, this is Finn, Dahlia, Ansa and Armo," Derek said, pointing at the others.  "Thank you," Hermione said, her 'borrowed' quick notes quill scribbling away.  "Anyway, does dear old daddy know?" Finn asked, smiling maliciously. He knew that Professor Slughorn would let them off the hook.  "As a matter of fact, he does," Draco said, trying his best to keep a confident face.  "Oo, really? So he should be bursting in here anytime now with his cane, wailing about his only son being a disappointment," Dahlia joked, receiving a high five from Ansa as the two girls laughed shrilly. Armo hung back, looking down at his shoes.  "Fag," Derek spat. Draco, Hermione, Ron and surprisingly, Armo all gasped as Harry stood up abruptly.  "Wanna say that again?" He growled, keeping a respectable distance away to avoid detention.  "You guys make me sick; even you two queers sitting together makes me want to kill myself," He smirked.  "Aw, we make your tummy upset, do we?" Harry grabbed Draco by the tie, pulled him up and smashed his lips against Draco's. Draco melted into the kiss as Harry opened his eyes and stared at the Slytherins. Finn, Derek, Dahlia and Anso all backed away and walked back to their spots. Draco and Harry pulled apart and sat back down. Draco stole a glance at the teachers. McGonagall was taking a sip of her drink, clearly ignoring it on purpose, and Draco swore he saw Professor Sprout hand Madam Pomfrey ten knuts. Someone cleared their throat behind them. Draco and Harry turned around to see Armo still standing there. "What the fuck do you want?" Harry said aggressively. Draco flicked Harry on the head, receiving an 'ow', but Draco could tell that Armo was different from the others.  "I just wanted to say that, um, I support you guys," He said awkwardly, staring at his shuffling feet.  "Hey, Armo, right?" Draco asked. He nodded.  "Let's go to the library, you, Harry and I. Right now," Draco said softly.  "O-Okay," Armo nodded. Draco and Harry got up and walked with Armo to the exit.  "Armo! What the hell are you doing!" Ansa yelled. Harry turned around and growled at her, making her sit back down. The three got to the library and found a secluded area. "Armo, somethings troubling you, isn't it?" Draco prodded.  "Yeah..." He responded quietly.  "What is it?" Draco asked.  "I think...I'm bi," He admitted.  "How do you know?" Harry asked gently.  "Well...I have a crush on Dennis Creevey...and Rose Zeller," He said awkwardly.  "Awh, that's tough. Why are you hanging out with those pricks, by the way?" Draco asked.  "Ansa's my twin, and whatever she tells me to do, I do. That's how it's always been," He said sadly.  "Except for being in Slytherin, I see," Harry said, looking at Armo's Hufflepuff uniform. Armo chuckled lightly.  "Listen, I know a Hufflepuff boy in your year. He doesn't have many friends, and I think it's time you found some real ones," Draco said.  "Who?" Armo asked.  "Martin Beccles," Draco replied.  "Martin Beccles? But he's...he's so...," Armo stammered.  "Cute? I know," Draco smirked. Harry elbowed him in the sides. Rolling his eyes, Draco kissed Harry on the cheek. "He's gay, by the way," Draco winked. Armo blushed as the other two laughed. "Come on, I'll introduce you guys," Draco stood up and held his hand out for Armo, pulling him up. As they walked out, Draco smiled to himself. He was comparing himself to the older Draco. Healthier, less confused, safe and happy. And it was all thanks to Harry.

Chapter Text
Draco stepped on the scale he found in the bathroom at Harry's place, 50.03 kilograms. A healthy weight. Harry hugged him from behind, "I'm so proud of you, baby," He murmured, kissing Draco on the neck. Tears began to fall from Draco's face. "Hey, it's okay. You are beautiful; you aren't fat. It's still a low weight, but it's healthy, and that's what matters," Harry whispered.  "But..." Draco whimpered.  "No. Draco, I am so proud of you. This is probably one of the hardest things for a person to go through. But I know that if I had to continue to watch you kill yourself, it would be one of the hardest things for me to go through. I don't want to lose you. And I will continue to help you recover, even if I make you hate me for it," Harry said, tears forming in his eyes. Draco hugged him tightly, clenching the fabric of Harry's shirt. Harry hugged him back as the two cried on each other. *** Christmas in Grimmauld Place was going well. Harry was right; Kreacher was absolutely thrilled to have a Malfoy in the house. He was also delighted to hear a prestigious pureblood approve of Kreacher new beliefs on blood purity, even though they had only changed minutely. The boys had also received a letter from Narcissa, letting them know that Lucius was fuming, but she wasn't tolerating any of his shit and was forcing him to educate himself.  Christmas morning arrived, and Draco groaned as he and Harry prepared to apparate to the Weasley's house at five in the bloody morning. They arrived in front of the warm and welcoming Weasley cottage, greeted by Ron and Hermione. They got their hellos out of the way and began to walk inside. "You won't believe who Ginny brought with her!" Ron exclaimed. They walked into the living room to see Ginny and Luna curled up on the couch together, their hands intertwined.  "Harry! My bi brother!" Ginny exclaimed, jumping over to him. Harry laughed and hugged her as Luna walked over dreamily.  "Hello Harry, Draco," She greeted. The conversation didn't get any further before Molly Weasley ran over to hug her favourite 'son'.  "And Draco," Molly cooed, opening her arms wide. Taken aback, it took Draco a second before hugging her. "Now, I want the boys out in the yard helping Arthur set up the Christmas tree," She ordered, "We splurged a little this year," She added coyly. "Girls, follow me to the kitchen!" She yelled, walking off. The boys and girls said goodbye as they went their separate ways.  The three went outside to see Arthur, Charlie Percy, George and Bill. Arthur had insisted on doing things the muggle way, and they were struggling to figure out the lights. "Ah! There you boys are!" Arthur hurried over and shook Harry's hand. Arthur held out his hand for Draco. Amazed again, Draco hesitated before shaking his hand. "Now, Harry, you must know how these lights work? They say you need three Double-A batteries; I didn't know batteries had varieties!" Arthur said. Harry chuckled and helped them figure out how to get things working. Surprisingly, Draco was just as intrigued as Arthur was. The lights turned on, and everyone 'oohed' and 'ahhed' at the colourful red, green and yellow lights. Next up was the baubles. The girls giggled as they watched the boys get bossed around by Draco because 'bauble structure and organisation is key!'. The fun had to end, though, because Molly was adamant about cooking what seemed to be a twelve-course meal. Even though they used magic, it took all day to finish. By the time night had come around, even their wands seemed to be tired. Taking a break, the boys set the table instead of the girls. For the duration of the day, they had been doing garden work, chopping wood and cleaning out Arthur's shed (Molly's orders). The boys took their seats as the girls walked out with the dishes floating behind them. As soon as the dishes touched the table, it was game on. Even Draco got somewhat involved.  Draco had never had a family dinner of this calibre. Sure it was nice eating fancy, expensive food in Paris, but it was nothing compared to the warm and fuzzy feeling he experienced at that table. Forgetting about his father, stupid kids at Hogwarts, his eating disorder and everything bad, he could fully enjoy himself. People were talking to him like he wasn't a villain, well, almost everyone. George hadn't said one single word to Draco. Ron said he would take some time, and Draco understood. He had made sure to wear long sleeves to cover his mark. The time came for presents. Draco had gotten something for everyone. Thanks to Harry's help, he was able to get perfect gifts for each individual. Something called an 'IPod' for Arthur, wooden cooking set for Molly, a pair of black studs for Bill, an ancient book of dragons for Charlie that Draco found in his home library a while ago, a silver hatband for Percy, his old collection of fancy pranking devices for George, a moving Chudley Canons figurine of the whole team for Ron, a new bed for Ginny's pygmy puff and a box of weird buttons that Draco secretly conjured for Luna. The presents were well received; George even smiled at Draco. "I'll give you yours later," Draco whispered to Harry.  "You can get yours later too," Harry whispered back.  "This one's for you," Luna said, passing a box to Draco.  "For me?" Draco asked, tentatively taking the box.  "Well yeah, it's your turn to receive presents," Ginny said. Draco received a dried flower press from Luna, an old snitch from Ginny since 'he'd never caught one', one of the newest arithmancy books from Hermione, a Falmouth Falcons poster from Ron, a bag of green apples from George (that received a lot of laughs), a gold brooch from Percy, a silver snake pendant from Charlie, a pair of spiky earrings from Bill (because Draco absolutely must pierce his ears), one of his necklaces that had been confiscated under suspicion of dark magic from Arthur and last but not least, a green and silver sweater with the letter D knitted on it from Molly. Draco was unwrapping the sweater when Molly said, "I know it's probably not as fancy as you'd like, but-" She was cut off.  "It's perfect," Draco said with a shaky voice, tears streaming down his face. Molly hugged him as he sobbed quietly. Soon the rest of them joined in for a group hug. Draco hadn't felt a part of a family for a long time. *** Draco and Harry waved their goodbyes before apparating back to Number 12 Grimmauld Place. The two walked in clumsily, slightly tipsy. "I have something for you," Draco said, scampering off to his room as Harry sat down on the couch and groaned. He would feel this later, but he smiled nervously as he felt the box in his pocket. Draco came in clutching an ornate chest, roughly the size of a regular muggle lunchbox. Draco handed it over to the other boy and awaited Harry's reaction nervously. Harry opened it. Inside was a new pair of glasses, pictures of Dobby that Draco had taken at the manor when he was younger and a drawing of Harry and Draco, signed by Armo. Harry went to close it before he noticed the inside of the box lid. It was like a mirror, except it wasn't his face; it was Draco's. "What's this?" He asked.  "It's enchanted to show my face no matter where I am or how far apart we are," Draco explained. "I love you so much," Harry said, setting the box down and grabbing Draco by his waist.  Draco wrapped his arms around Harry's neck, "I love you so much too,". The two laughed before Harry pulled away.  "I have something for you too," He grinned.  He took out the small box from his pocket and dropped it on the floor. He kneeled on one knee to get it as Draco giggled. But Harry didn't get up. Instead, he looked up at Draco with a slightly scared face. He opened it, and inside were two engagement bands. They were made out of onyx stone with a silver lining on each side. Draco gasped and covered his mouth. "Draco...I know we're only young but...I've never loved anyone before you. And I think you're the one. Would you marry me, Malfoy?" Harry asked, a shakiness in his voice. Small tears were streaming down Draco's face.  "It's Malfoy-Potter to you, mister," He replied, doing that happy sort of cry-laugh. Hardy smiled and slipped one of the bands onto Draco's ring finger before slipping the other in his own. He stood up and pulled Draco in. The two kissed; it was soft, warm, loving. Every terrible memory floated away from both boys' minds as they thought of only each other. Perhaps, what they'd been through over all the years made their love more robust, more real. They 'hated' each other but always found themselves together. They'd helped each other and even other people who they had never met. They would feel this love for the rest of their lives through fights and hardships. They would always find each other.
