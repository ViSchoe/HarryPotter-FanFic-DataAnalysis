Work Text:
Draco came from Wiltshire and he was prone to be dramatic.
He studied potions at Hogwarts School of Magic.
That’s where he,
Met Harry,
Draco bragged and said his Dad was loaded,
Got involved with a Dark Lord, his life imploded,
But in the end,
Harry wanted to be his friend.
And then in thirty seconds time Malfoy said:I want to live like a common wizard,
I want to live like you and the Weasleys do.
Want to sleep with with a common wizard,
(Basically Potter I’d like to sleep with you)Well, what else could Harry do?
Flushed red behind his glasses and said,
“I’ll see what I can do.”Harry took Draco on a Muggle bus ride.
Thought that Draco would feel horrified.
Well. Malfoy almost cried.
Harry said, “pretend you’ve got no magic,”
Draco laughed, said, “that would be so tragic,”
Harry said, “Yeah?
Well nobody else here is a wizard.
Are you sure?”You want to live like a common wizard,
Want to live like Ron, Hermione and me?
Want to sleep with with a common wizard,
Want to sleep with with a common wizard like me?Draco rode the bus with Harry by his side,
(Finishing that journey was a point of pride.)
Lose your Elves, you vault of gold,
Choose a future that’s untold.
Drink some Firewhiskey, play Quidditch.
(But marry Harry, not some witch)
And one day you’ll get this right,
‘Cause though you and Harry might fight,
Your Dad is locked in Azkaban, oh yeah.  You don’t need to be a common wizard,
‘Cause Harry loves you and your fancy ways.
You don’t need to be a common wizard.
And you know? He’ll love you all your days. But in future Draco? Use the floo.
‘Cause riding the Muggle bus?
Love, that’s not for you.
