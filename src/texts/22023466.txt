The glasses on Draco’s nose were thin and a bit crooked despite the owner’s efforts to keep them in place. He was reading in bed, the soft duvet covering his legs, his hair neatly combed in a side braid, when the tap-tap of his owl’s beak broke his concentration.“Hermes?” he called.“I’ll get him,” Harry said, walking towards the window.He greeted the owl with a pat on his feathered head and gave him a treat before watching him take off once again.“Busy night.”“It’s always like this during the festivities,” Draco replied, noticing the postcard in his hands. “Our sons?”“They are in Cuba now, it’s beautiful.”“Oh.”Harry sat on the bed and showed Draco the colorful postcard accompanied by a picture of Scorpius and Albus waving and smiling at them.“They look happy.”“They are,” Harry replied.Draco took off his glasses, placed them on his book.“They are so young, and yet … they have each other; they know their feelings for each other and don’t deny them. They are very lucky.”“We are too,” Harry hummed, caressing Draco’s chin.“We wasted so much time though …”“We won’t do that again,” he said, pressing a loving kiss on his husband’s lips.
