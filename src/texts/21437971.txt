As always, the favoured medium for art this year is Digital - there were four times as many artworks created using photoshop (and similar art programs) than traditional pencil works. There were also 3 comic submissions this year, 1 less than last year.
We also have a record breaking massive 125 page comic! The first comic that is longer than 25 pages in 10 years!
Breakdown of timeline-related tags: Post-Hogwarts (28), Harry Potter Epilogue What Epilogue | EWE (25), Post-Second War with Voldemort (5)

There were some fanworks that can be placed in any era and/or are non-linear, but the most preferred Era was without doubt Post-Hogwarts (or adult H/D Post-Second War with Voldemort), out of which only 3 stories are semi-epilogue compliant with no Nextgen Potters and only Scorpius Malfoy being featured. The rest - art included - are EWE.
We also see 1 Hogwarts Era story set in Eight Year and 1 University Era story where Draco is a student! The low numbers are not unusual for a career-themed fair.
There is also 1 Non-Magical AU! One more than we did last year!

Harry and Draco are animagi in 2 stories each with cat animagus being the more popular form (2 out of 4 works).
Our most popular career trope yet is Animal-related Occupations with 10 entries! Harry is more likely to have an animal breeder, seller or carer type career as compared to Draco (6 versus 2 works). Furthermore, Draco is a veterinarian in two other works!
Not only is Draco good with animal healing, he is also good with humans as well (EMT, physiotherapy, psychologist, healer)!
Harry, on the other hand, did not have a single healing-related career! He is more likely a Ministry of Magic Employee as compared to Draco (4 out of 6 works).
Unsurprisingly, the potioneer or potions master role is exclusively Draco's, with 3 stories! He is also more likely to work with wood *cough*, I mean plants, in 4 separate occasions compared to Harry's 2.
Draco and Harry are both equally likely to be sexy Quidditch Players or Broomstick Racers, with three fics each. Harry has a more varied Broomstick-related career because he also dabbles as a broomstick maker and a Quidditch team owner in two works!
In addition to that, Draco and Harry have teaching positions in 3 fanworks each, charming/invention careers in 2 fanworks each, and spell breaking in 1 fanwork each.
Only 1 story has a sex-related career - with Draco being a WWW sex toy tester.
Some of the more unusual careers we have received this year mostly involves Draco: Professional Breaker-Upper, Ghost Hunter, Marie Kondo | Organising consultant, Fake Psychic, Commercial Fisherman, Private Island Caretaker, and Yarn Shop Owner.
Harry also has a few unusual careers this year: Pirate, Knight Bus Driver, and Cage Duellist.
