Work Text:
The man laid on the ground, breathing ragged, as a boy knelt down in front of him, a vial held up to his eyes. A single tear fell into it, and the boy quirked the vial with a sigh. Something bitter shadowed the man’s expression, so different than the sour looks he always wore. Rueful, eyebrows drawn together, lips open into a breathless laugh. 
“You have your Mother's eyes.”
The child’s voice was desolate, mourning—not for the man in front of him, but something deeper, the what if’s and wishes and wants weaved throughout the universe. Those green, emerald eyes swam with liquid salt, stinging. His mouth was drawn up into a firm line, eyebrows pinched, but expression smooth and unwavering.
“And the Son of Lily Evans curses you.”
Snape's eyes shut, a sad smile tugging on his lips. “I suppose I’ve been a fool, Lily.”
And then it was only a boy and a corpse.
Harry choked, words clogged in his heart, unspoken. His fist clenched, eyes scrunched tightly, lips pressed. Too much to say, too little time. He opened his mouth anyways, teeth clenched and aching.
“I wasn’t finished, damnit.”
Collapsed onto the tile, his hand opening weakly as his tears continued to flow. “...I wasn’t finished.”
Then he laughed, a breathless little thing. “Even in the end, you never listen to me.” 
His voice rang hollow across the cold stone he kneeled upon, his hand wiping his tears, vile clasped tightly. 
He stands up, and continues on, anyways.
There is no time to mourn possibilities; Harry knew that.
Maybe that was the difference between them.
